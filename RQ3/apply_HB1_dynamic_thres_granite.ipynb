      "It seems like there are several issues in your setup that might be causing problems with `grunt-browser-sync`. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Grunt CLI**: Ensure you have the Grunt Command Line Interface (CLI) installed globally on your system. If not, install it using npm:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   npm install -g grunt-cli\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   npm init\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "   npm install\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "There is a pretty straightforward pattern called the Builder Pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) where methods basically return a reference to the current object, so that instead of chaining method calls on one another they are chained on the object reference. The actual Builder pattern described in the Gang of Four book is a little verbose (why create a builder object) instead just return a reference to self from each setXXX() for clean method chaining. That could look something like this in Python: class Person: def setName(self, name): self.name = name return self ## this is what makes this work def setAge(self, age): self.age = age; return self; def setSSN(self, ssn): self.ssn = ssn return self And you could create a person like so: p = Person() p.setName(\"Hunter\") .setAge(24) .setSSN(\"111-22-3333\") Keep in mind that you will actually have to chain the methods with them touching p.a().b().c() because Python doesn't ignore whitespace. As @MaciejGol notes in the comments you can assign to p like this to chain with whitespace: p = ( Person().setName('Hunter') .setAge(24) .setSSN('111-22-3333') ) Whether or not this is the best style/idea for Python I can't say, but this is sort of how it would look in Java.\n",

It is not a requirement, but in this case you need to pass arg to str.__new__ so you must intercept arg. The method myClass.__new__ is executed. This method will create the object myInstance. __new__ is the real constructor (__init__ isn't a constructor !). In pseudocode, __new__ look something like this : It is not the responsibility of __new__ to call __init__, as demonstrated by this simple example: class C: def __new__(cls): print('entering __new__') self = super().__new__(cls) print('exiting __new__') return self def __init__(self): print('entering __init__') super().__init__() print('exiting __init__') C() # Output: # entering __new__ # exiting __new__ # entering __init__ # exiting __init__ As you can see, in my __new__ I didn't call __init__ explicitly, and object.__new__ is not calling __init__ either. __init__ is automatically called by the Python interpreter itself whenever __new__ returns an instance of the type. The situation is a little different when we are using immutable types (str, int, float, tuple). This is not entirely true. The situation is different when we are inheriting from a type that is not using the default __new__ implementation. The default __new__ implementation (i.e. object.__new__) is very permissive and ignores every positional argument and keyword argument. If you replace it with a less permissive implementation, then problems like the one you are observing happen. What is important to understand is that the problem is not brought by the non-default __new__ itself, but by the fact that our __init__ is not compatible with __new__. foo.__new__(foo, arg = 1) # That works because the method __new__ look like this : def __new__(*args, **kargs). str.__new__(str, arg = 1) # That fails because we are trying to pass the attribute 'arg' to a method which look like this : def __new__(anUniqueValue). You got it. Just one bit is wrong: the correct signature for str.__new__ is: def __new__(cls[, object[, encoding[, errors]]]) All arguments except cls are both positional and keyword argument. In fact you can do: >>> class C(str): ... def __init__(self, object): ... pass ... >>> C('abc') 'abc' >>> C(object='abc') 'abc' You see? We used a signature for __init__ that is compatible with str.__new__ and now we can avoid overriding __new__!\n",

In Python everything is an instance of something. Classes are not an exclusion, they are instances of metaclasses. In Python 2 there are two kinds of classes — old-style (class Foo: pass) and new-style (class Foo(object): pass). Old-style classes are instances of classobj, visible as types.ClassType, while new-style classes are instances of type, which itself is both function and metaclass at the same time (callable metaclass to be strict). In Python 3, there are only new-style classes, always derived from object (which in turn is instance of type). So, you can check if Foo is class, by issuing if it's an instance of metaclass producing classes: class Foo(object): pass if isinstance(Foo, type): print(\"Yep, it's new-style class\") Or for old-style: import types class Foo: pass if isinstance(Foo, types.ClassType): print(\"Yep, it's old-style class\") You can also take a look at data model (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) and list of class-specific magic fields (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__bases__).\n",

      "Wow, I love this question. And is pretty challenging too! This was one of my first time to take a recursive approach to a certain problem.

That children property is filled with all the trees returned from each of the children associated with the root. If there are no children, it simply returns a tree object without any children. Honestly my code might be a little hard to read for the reason of being a recursive one, so it might help to print some values in the middle of the function. Now this one is with the constraint (just that if (index_of_root !== -1){ is replaced by if (index_of_root !== -1 && children.length !== 2){): let root = 2; // more complicated data (with 1 branch that doesn't connect to any other node) let nodes = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 8], [100, 101]]; function createTree(root, nodes){ let children = []; for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++){ const index_of_root = nodes[i].indexOf(root) if (index_of_root !== -1 && children.length !== 2){ children.push(nodes[i][Number(!index_of_root)]); // note that data like [1,2,4] or [1] will not work. nodes.splice(i, 1); i--; // after removing the element, decrement the iterator } } let tree = { id: String(root) }; if (children.length !== 0){ // if there are any children, tree.children = []; // add the children property to the tree object for (let child of children){ tree.children.push(createTree(child, nodes)); // then add the tree of each of the children } } return tree; } console.log(createTree(root, nodes)); //notice how [2, 8] pair is excluded from the tree Hope that helped.

      "To apply prototype inheritance to every descendant element in JavaScript, you can use the `prototype` chain to define shared properties and methods for all elements in a hierarchical structure. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to achieve this using a tree-like structure similar to the ones you provided:\n",

      "First, define a base class for your elements:\n",

      "Utilizing context management with MySQLdb in Python\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously (https://stackoverflow.com/a/22840557/190597), MySQLdb connections were context managers. As of this commit on 2018-12-04 (https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python/commit/c64915b1e5c705f4fb10e86db5dcfed0b58552cc), however, MySQLdb connections are no longer context managers, and users must explicitly call conn.commit() or conn.rollback(), or write their own context manager, such as the one below. You could use something like this: import config import MySQLdb import MySQLdb.cursors as mc import _mysql_exceptions import contextlib DictCursor = mc.DictCursor SSCursor = mc.SSCursor SSDictCursor = mc.SSDictCursor Cursor = mc.Cursor @contextlib.contextmanager def connection(cursorclass=Cursor, host=config.HOST, user=config.USER, passwd=config.PASS, dbname=config.MYDB, driver=MySQLdb): connection = driver.connect( host=host, user=user, passwd=passwd, db=dbname, cursorclass=cursorclass) try: yield connection except Exception: connection.rollback() raise else: connection.commit() finally: connection.close() @contextlib.contextmanager def cursor(cursorclass=Cursor, host=config.HOST, user=config.USER, passwd=config.PASS, dbname=config.MYDB): with connection(cursorclass, host, user, passwd, dbname) as conn: cursor = conn.cursor() try: yield cursor finally: cursor.close() with cursor(SSDictCursor) as cur: print(cur) connection = cur.connection print(connection) sql = 'select * from table' cur.execute(sql) for row in cur: print(row) To use it you would place config.py in your PYTHONPATH and define the HOST, USER, PASS, MYDB variables there.\n",
      "\n",
      "MySQLdb does not support the context manager protocol. Roll your own, or use oursql instead. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8067690/context-manager-for-pythons-mysqldb)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Python DBAPI was written well before context managers were added to the Python language. As such, different database libraries made their own decisions on how to implement context manager support (if they implemented it at all). Usually using the database as a context manager ties you to a transaction. The transaction is started on __enter__, and committed or aborted on __exit__, depending on wether or not there was an exception. As such, you are supposed to use the MySQL connection as a context manager after connecting seperately: connection = util.get_db_connection() with connection as cursor: cursor.execute(...) # connection commit is issued if no exceptions were raised. The sqlite3 context manager implementation (http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html#using-the-connection-as-a-context-manager) is subtly different; it also manages transactions, but does not return a cursor from the __enter__ method: con = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\") with con: cursor = con.cursor() # or use the connection directly con.execute(...) Technically, it just returns self on __enter__.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there are two main issues going on here- one appears to be python code and the other is the structure of how you're interacting to your DB. First, you're not closing your connection. This depends on your application's needs - you have to decide how long it should stay open. Reference this SO question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5504340/python-mysqldb-connection-close-vs-cursor-close) from contextlib import closing with closing( connection.cursor() ) as cursor: ... use the cursor ... # cursor closed. Guaranteed. connection.close() Right now, you have to interrupt your program with Ctl+C because there's no reason for your with statement to stop running. Second, start thinking about your interactions with the DB in terms of 'transactions'. Do something, commit it to the DB, if it didn't work, rollback, if it did, close the connection. Here's a tutorial (http://zetcode.com/db/mysqlpython/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Your error is happening when you exit the with block and connection.__exit__ is called, not at the print statement. When you look at this part of MySQLdb code, you see: def __enter__(self): return self.cursor() def __exit__(self, exc, value, tb): if exc: self.rollback() else: self.commit() So this immediately tells us two things: There is a previous exception that is shadowed by rollback() call that itself causes an exception Your first line should be) with conn as cur:, because cur will be assigned the result of connection.__enter__(). It is hard to say why exactly you get this error, because we don't know where your cursor comes from. You should change your first line as suggested above and it will probably work. If not, get rid of the context manager entirely, and you will be able to see the original exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your custom implementation you need to \"yield\" a cursor object which will be bound in the as clause of the with statement: 3 fixes required in your code: passing num to be assigned to self.num = num yielding cursor adding as keyword to with statement from contextlib import contextmanager class DatabaseReader(): def __init__(self, db_connection, num): self.db_connection = db_connection self.num = num @contextmanager def connect(self): cursor = self.db_connection.cursor(buffered=True) try: yield cursor finally: cursor.close() def read(self): with self.connect() as cur: cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM table;\")\n",
      "\n",
      "The pythonic way would be to close in the _ exit _ statement the resource you opened in the _ enter _ statement (to prevent memory leaks etc). But connections are meant to be reused so we don't need to close them everytime. If you want to reuse connections try researching how connection pooling works in pyodbc and if you don't then close the connection in the _ exit _ method. Anyway you still need the _ exit _ method to fulfill the context manager protocol. In your case the _ exit _ statement manages exceptions. I don't think that including the runQuery() method in in the _ enter _ statement is a good idea. # !BAD example with db_connection_run_query(connect_string, query) as query_result: ... Query_result is just a list of Rows - you don't need a context manager to work with it. BTW your runQuery method doesn't close the cursor. This is also a potential memory leak. You need to close it in the finally clause before returning the result. (context manager might also help here) try: cursor = self.connector.cursor() result_list = cursor.execute(query).fetchall() except Exception: print(\"query failed\") finally: cursor.close() return result_list One more thing. Your runQuery method will only work with select queries and not with inserts, updates and deletes (To perform those you need to commit a transaction by calling commit() on cursor). So you may consider renaming runQuery to runSelectQuery.\n",

      "I have solved my problem with ContextDecorator as below. from contextlib import ContextDecorator class my_connect(ContextDecorator): def __init__(self): self.data_base_connection = '' def __enter__(self): self.data_base_connection = mysql.connect( host=settings.DATABASES['data_base_name'].get('HOST', 'localhost'), user=settings.DATABASES['data_base_name']['USER'], passwd=settings.DATABASES['data_base_name'].get('PASSWORD', ''), db=settings.DATABASES['data_base_name']['NAME'], cursorclass=cursors.DictCursor) cursor = self.data_base_connection.cursor() return cursor def __exit__(self, *exc): self.data_base_connection.close() return False In query_tables() i just call my_connect() with with keyword def query_tables(): with my_connect() as cursor: #rest of the statements\n",

See https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/43 (https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/43) for an explanation for why conn.close() is not called. Note that unlike the original code, this causes conn.commit() to be called. Use the outer with statement to control when you want commit to be called. Also note that regardless of whether or not you use the with statements, per the docs (https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Connection#close), Connections are automatically closed when they are deleted (typically when they go out of scope) so you should not normally need to call [conn.close()], but you can explicitly close the connection if you wish. and similarly for cursors (https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Cursor#close) (my emphasis): Cursors are closed automatically when they are deleted (typically when they go out of scope), so calling [csr.close()] is not usually necessary.\n",

      "One thing you should know that connecting to your database directly with javascript is a bad practice due to many reasons. Here is how you should connect to the database using jQuery: First change will be to copy the lines of code you have into a method and decorate the method with [WebMethod] attribute. This will be called via ajax to process the request via client side. e.g [WebMethod] public static void DoSomething() { string email = string.Empty; SqlCommand cmdFindInfo = new SqlCommand(\"SELECT Email FROM iDen_Login WHERE(Email=@email)\", conLogin); cmdFindInfo.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@email\", txtbxMembEmail.Value); SqlDataReader rdr = cmdFindInfo.ExecuteReader(); while (rdr.Read()) { email = rdr[\"Email\"].ToString(); } rdr.Close(); } then in your markup page you can call this method like below: $.ajax({ method: 'POST', url: 'MyPage.aspx/DoSomething', accept: 'application/json', contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8', success: function(){ console.log('success'); }, fail: function(err){ console.log(err); } }); Above is an example that will help you connect to sql server with ajax calls. BUT if you strictly want to connect to the sql directly and not through C# at all, then I would recommend you go through this answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/857688/4308286).

Even if you could hook it up in terms of the protocol and port and such, A) You'd have problems with security policies, and B) It would be a Really, Really Bad Idea to allow clients direct access to the DB. So the typical architecture is: Client -> mid-tier -> database These days it's not atypical for the mid-tier to be some kind of web service exposing a REST, XML, or JSON API. You have lots and lots of choices for the mid-tier. Certainly C# and ASP.Net is one choice, but only one. There's Ruby on Rails, there's any number of JVM-based frameworks (Java EE, Play!, ...), there's PHP, there's Node.js... I suppose one choice for the mid-tier is SQL Server itself. SQL Server 2005 offers a built-in set of web services you can enable via SOAP/HTTP (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345123%28v=sql.90%29.aspx). You would probably still run into issues with the Same Origin Policy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy), since I assume you won't be serving your web pages from the SQL Server. :-) Or maybe you could get around that, by configuring IIS to proxy for the SQL Server's SOAP/HTTP stuff and also to serve your pages, so they'd all be on the same origin (the host and port of the IIS server).\n",

      "SQL is a squirrel with a wheelbarrow. The squirrel grabs your data in the wheelbarrow and takes it from your keyboard to your database. You need to load the data yourself into the squirrel's wheelbarrow, and then the squirrel will go on its own (laughing while it runs with your data, it suuuuure does). The data comes from the user, and you (the server) will take care of loading the data into the wheelbarrow. How? It will get technical from here. =) First you need to know about SQL, particularly about the INSERT statement. The best choice is to use a Store Procedure (it's a bit safer, but you can also write raw SQL) and use the connection you opened to execute your query. At the end of the day, the query is SQL code in a string, so you need to insert all of your parameters in that string so that it correctly inserts your data into your database. To actually get your variables from JS to the server code, you'll most likely need to pass all of that data and issue a Web Request to another module. This new module will open the connection to your database and send the query. This is server-side code (node.js, php, asp.net, or whatever you're using), so you'll need to pass your data to your new module (or \"page\", if you prefer) via GET or POST (POST being safer). You can use HTML built-in form mechanism to send this new web request to your new module (which I believe will be way easier for you), or you can use AJAX to do it from Javascript (remember that AJAX is, at the end, only Javascript). A good resource to learn all this fairly quickly is w3schools/ (http://www.w3schools.com/). Take your time to learn this stuff because it's important. In a nutshell: user(client)->html->javascript->you(server)->php et al.->sql, and then it goes all the way back. Good luck. --EDIT-- About GET and POST (http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ajax_xmlhttprequest_send.asp), if you use GET you're gonna pass all your data in the form of variables directly into the URL of your PHP module (\"www.stuff.com?var1=value1&var2=value2\"). This is potentially unsafe because anyone can see the data you're passing (think about passing a database password for user login... not cool). If you use POST, you'll use xmlhttp.send(\"var1=value1&var2=value2\"), passing the values in the exact same way. Functionally, it's the same thing as GET.

      "Reversing Bubble Sort: Organizing Numbers from Maximum to Minimum in Python\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In your code, the index i is the largest index that the inner loop will consider when swapping the elements. The way bubble sort works is by swapping sibling elements to move the largest element to the right. This means that after the first outer iteration (or the first full cycle of the inner loop), the largest element of your list is positioned at the far end of the list. So it’s already in its correct place and does not need to be considered again. That’s why for the next iteration, i is one less to skip the last element and only look at the items 0..len(lst)-1. Then in the next iteration, the last two elements will be sorted correctly, so it only needs to look at the item 0..len(lst)-2, and so on. So you want to decrement i since more and more elements at the end of the list will be already in its correct position and don’t need to be looked at any longer. You don’t have to do that; you could also just always have the inner loop go up to the very end but you don’t need to, so you can skip a few iterations by not doing it. I asked why we are going reverse in the list like len(list)-1,0. Why are we not going forward way like 0,len(list)-1? I was hoping that the above explanation would already cover that but let’s go into detail. Try adding a print(i, alist) at the end of the outer loop. So you get the result for every iteration of i: >>> bubbleSort([5, 1, 3, 9, 2, 8, 0]) 6 [1, 3, 5, 2, 8, 0, 9] 5 [1, 3, 2, 5, 0, 8, 9] 4 [1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9] 3 [1, 2, 0, 3, 5, 8, 9] 2 [1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9] 1 [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9] As you can see, the list will be sorted from the right to the left. This works well for our index i which will limit how far the inner loop will go: For i = 4 for example, we already have 3 sorted elements at the end, so the inner loop will only have to look at the first 4 elements. Now, let’s try changing the range to go in the other direction. The loop will be for i in range(0, len(alist)). Then we get this result: >>> bubbleSort([5, 1, 3, 9, 2, 8, 0]) 0 [5, 1, 3, 9, 2, 8, 0] 1 [1, 5, 3, 9, 2, 8, 0] 2 [1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 8, 0] 3 [1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 8, 0] 4 [1, 3, 5, 2, 9, 8, 0] 5 [1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 9, 0] 6 [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 0, 9] As you can see, this is not sorted at all. But why? i still limits how far the inner loop will go, so at i = 1, the loop will only look at the first pair and sort that; the rest will stay the same. At i = 2, the loop will look at the first two pairs and swap those (once!); the rest will stay the same. And so on. By the time the inner loop can reach the last element (which is only on the final iteration), there aren’t enough iterations left to swap the zero (which also happens to be the smallest element) to the very left. This is again because bubble sort works by sorting the largest elements to the rightmost side first. So we have to start the algorithm by making the inner loop be able to reach that right side completely. Only when we are certain that those elements are in the right position, we can stop going that far. There is one way to use a incrementing outer loop: By sorting the smallest elements first. But this also means that we have to start the inner loop on the far right side to make sure that we check all elements as we look for the smallest element. So we really have to make those loops go in the opposite directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should not increment the start index each loop, but decrement the end index, like: def bubble_sort(arr): flag = True for i in range(1, len(arr)): if not flag: return arr flag = False for j in range(len(arr) - i): if arr[j] > arr[j+1]: arr[j+1], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[j+1] flag = True return arr Each iteration you move the cursor from left to right. That means that if the cursor finds the maximum value, it will move that value to the right end of the list. But the same does not hold for the minimum value. If the cursor finds the minimum value, it will only move it one position to the left. That is why you should keep starting from the start of the list each iteration.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided explanation is spot-on regarding why reversing the range in the inner loop of bubble sort is crucial for organizing numbers from maximum to minimum instead of minimum to maximum. Here's a breakdown of why the inner loop should decrement the `end` index (`len(arr) - i`) rather than increment the `start` index (`i`):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Positioning**: When the outer loop starts, the largest element is already at the end of the list (index `len(arr) - 1`). To ensure this element stays in its correct position throughout the process, the inner loop must be able to access it during each iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Moving Elements Rightwards**: During each pass through the inner loop, the largest unsorted element found so far is moved to the rightmost unsorted part of the array. Therefore, the inner loop must start at the beginning of the unsorted portion of the array and move towards the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decrementing End Index**: By decrementing the `end` index (`len(arr) - i`), the inner loop effectively shrinks the range it needs to scan with each iteration of the outer loop. Once the largest elements are in their correct positions at the end of the list, subsequent passes can focus solely on smaller subsets of the array, speeding up the sorting process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Avoiding Early Termination**: If the inner loop were to increment the `start` index (`i`), the algorithm might prematurely terminate before fully sorting the array. This would leave smaller elements misplaced, especially if they're not adjacent to larger ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Efficiency Considerations**: Decrementing the `end` index ensures that the largest elements are consistently moved to the right edge of the array, allowing smaller elements to be processed more efficiently in later iterations.\n",

      "Do you know of how I would be able to iterate over this dictionary...? I would break the data structure into two parts; An immutable set of \"thread slots\" (i.e., dictionary keys) over which you can iterate, and a second part, a dictionary that maps slot->thread or slot->whatever, that you can mutate during the iteration. The keys can just be integers, so... for slot in range(NUM_THREADS): ...access and mutate ServiceDict[slot] here... what I'm trying to achieve is a script that will loop indefinitely, starting threads, and restarting threads when they are finished. I'm saying, change your architecture. Don't continually re-start threads. Don't let the threads die. In your mind, you need to divorce the idea of threads from the idea of work that threads perform. A thread is a thing that executes your code. I like to use the word \"task\" to describe the things that you want your threaded code to do. In your present architecture, you create one thread for each task, and then you let the thread die when the task is completed. I'm saying, keep the threads alive, and let each thread wait for a next task instead of dying when it finishes its current task. Depending on the size of the tasks, this can be much more efficient than creating and destroying a thread for each task. Creating and destroying threads is expensive. That's where a thread pool (https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) comes in. It's exactly the purpose for which thread pools were invented. A thread pool keeps a stable of \"worker threads\" that sit around waiting for tasks. When your main thread (or any thread) calls thread_pool.submit(new_task, ...task args...), one of the workers will pick that new_task from the pool's task queue, perform the task, and then go back to waiting for the next task. Each call to thread_pool.submit(...) returns a Future (https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Future) object. Your main thread (or whatever thread) can use the Future to wait for the task to be finished and optionally, to get a result from the finished task. Or, you can just throw the Future away if you don't want to wait. lock files are used to see if a thread has finished or not. Sometimes, it can be reasonable to use the file system as a means for communication between processes, but there are much more efficient ways to communicate between threads within a single process. Here's a few examples, arranged in increasing order of power. https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html?highlight=event#threading.Event (https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html?highlight=event#threading.Event) https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html?highlight=semaphore#threading.Semaphore (https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html?highlight=semaphore#threading.Semaphore) https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html?highlight=queue#queue.Queue (https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html?highlight=queue#queue.Queue) Describing all of the ways in which you could use those things is a book level topic. In fact, here's a link to a free book that just talks about things you can do with Semaphores. It's an old book, and there may be newer better ways to do some of the things it shows you, but my point is for you to see just how powerful even a simple thing like a Semaphore can be. https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/ (https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/)\n",

      "You need to implement your own locking for all shared variables that will be modified in Python. You don't have to worry about reading from the variables that won't be modified (ie, concurrent reads are ok), so immutable types (frozenset, tuple, str) are probably safe, but it wouldn't hurt. For things you're going to be changing - list, set, dict, and most other objects, you should have your own locking mechanism (while in-place operations are ok on most of these, threads can lead to super-nasty bugs - you might as well implement locking, it's pretty easy). By the way, I don't know if you know this, but locking is very easy in Python - create a threading.lock object, and then you can acquire/release it like this: import threading list1Lock = threading.Lock() with list1Lock: # change or read from the list here # continue doing other stuff (the lock is released when you leave the with block) In Python 2.5, do from __future__ import with_statement; Python 2.4 and before don't have this, so you'll want to put the acquire()/release() calls in try:...finally: blocks: import threading list1Lock = threading.Lock() try: list1Lock.acquire() # change or read from the list here finally: list1Lock.release() # continue doing other stuff (the lock is released when you leave the with block) Some very good information about thread synchronization in Python (https://web.archive.org/web/20201101025814id_/http://effbot.org/zone/thread-synchronization.htm).\n",
      "\n",
      "You may need to synchronize access to a dictionary object when your keys are not unique per thread. Access is not necessarily thread safe. You can always use the dis (disassembler) module (http://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html) to verify any python code; python thread context can switch between any opcode (opcodes themselves are executed atomically); access to a dict can be spread over several opcodes: >>> def foo(): ... somedict = {} ... somedict['bar'] = 'spam' ... >>> import dis >>> dis.dis(foo) 2 0 BUILD_MAP 0 3 STORE_FAST 0 (somedict) 3 6 LOAD_CONST 1 ('spam') 9 LOAD_FAST 0 (somedict) 12 LOAD_CONST 2 ('bar') 15 STORE_SUBSCR 16 LOAD_CONST 0 (None) 19 RETURN_VALUE There are 4 opcodes involved with the somedict['bar'] = spam line, loading the somedict reference, loading the 'bar' and 'spam' constants, and calling the store operation. Thread contexts can be switched between any of these opcodes. That said, if your keys are guaranteed to be unique per thread, you could get away with not locking the structure; like all opcodes, the STORE_SUBSCR opcode is executed by the python interpreter under the GIL, so multiple threads storing in and reading information from their own key should be safe. The Python standard library library does this in a few locations; using thread.thread_ident() as a dictionary key to store per-thread information in a dictionary. The threading module (http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/threading.py) for example, keeps a _active module-global dictionary keyed on thread identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the threading module (http://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html) or the thread module (http://docs.python.org/2/library/thread.html#module-thread). Here's an example using the thread module: import thread d = dict() m = thread.allocate_lock() def foo(): m.acquire_lock() print(d['key']) def bar(): d['key'] = 'value' m.release_lock() if __name__ == '__main__': m.acquire_lock() t1 = thread.start_new_thread(foo,()) t2 = thread.start_new_thread(bar,()) This illustrates how locks can synchronize thread access to shared resources: as long as m is locked, foo is waiting to acquire it; meanwhile, bar updates the dictionary and releases the lock; only then does foo acquire the lock and continues. No joins. (Of course, this is not how you should write multithreaded code...) EDIT If you have to use processes, you can find similar functionality in the multiprocessing module (http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/multiprocessing.html). Here's an example: import multiprocessing def foo(m, d): m.acquire() print(d['key']) def bar(m, d): d['key'] = 'value' m.release() if __name__ == '__main__': manager = multiprocessing.Manager() m = multiprocessing.Lock() m.acquire() d = manager.dict() p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=foo, args=(m, d)) p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=bar, args=(m, d)) p1.start() p2.start() The Lock allows process synchronization, and the Manager allows resource sharing for compound types like lists and dictionaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update Based on your updated code/description where the dictionary has no keys added or deleted but integer values of existing keys might be changed by a process and the change reflected to other processes using the dictionary, then there are two approaches: Use a managed dictionary (e.g. multiprocessing.Manager().dict()). As you have noted, accessing or modifying key values are somewhat expensive since it results in making a remote method call to the actual dictionary that resides in a process created by the SyncManager instance. But multiprocessing is only advantageous if your worker function(s) are sufficiently CPU-intensive such that what is gained by running these functions in parallel more than offsets what is lost due to the additional overhead incurred by multiprocessing (e.e. process creation and inter-process communication). So you need to ask how much of your total processing is represented by the accessing of the dictionary values. If it is a significant portion then this is not the best approach but perhaps also your processes are not sufficiently CPU-intensive to warrant a multiprocessing approach. Use multiprocessing.Value instances as the values for the dictionary. Each process will have its own copy of the dictionary but the values stored are sharable because they reside in shared memory. These instances can be created with or without a lock. Updates under control of a lock to force updates to be \"one-at-a-time\" would be required if the updating logic is not atomic. For example, if you decide that a new value for key 'x' needs to be replaced and this new value is not based on the value of something that is being shared (which might get updated while you are executing your update logic), then you just need a statement such as d['x'].value = new_value. However, an update such as d[x].value += 1 needs to be done under control of a lock: with d['x'].get_lock(): d['x'].value += 1. In the code below, which is a modified version of my third coding example that I originally posted (since this version is closes to the approach you are taking, i.e. using multiprocessing.Process instances with a multiprocssing.Queue), I am following the second approach outlined above and using a regular dictionary with multiprocessing.Value instances as the values. I have added code just to show how an update made by one process is visible to the other processes. Normally, the way I am updating a value, i.e. first reading the current value and then replacing the value with a new value computed from the current value, would require that these operations be done under control of a lock to ensure that no other process can be modifying this key's value while this non-atomic logic is being performed. I am, however, not doing this under control of a lock just because I don't believe that the way you are updating values requires a lock and I didn't want to imply otherwise. from multiprocessing import Process, cpu_count, Queue, Value, current_process def user_choices(): props = {'deep': Value('i', 0, lock=False)} lead_type = input('Put Leader type: ') props['lead_type'] = Value('i', int(lead_type), lock=False) return props def processing(): props = user_choices() processors = [ 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah' ] queue = Queue() n_processors = cpu_count() for p in processors: queue.put(p) for _ in range(n_processors): # Use None as the sentinel so it cannot be mistaken for actual data: queue.put(None) procs = [Process(target=processes, args=(queue, props)) for _ in range(n_processors)] for p in procs: p.start() for p in procs: p.join() def processes(queue, props): import time while True: process = queue.get() if process is None: # Sentinel break v = props['lead_type'] if v.value == 1: new_value = 2 else: new_value = 1 v.value = new_value print(f\"Process {current_process().pid} is setting props['lead_type'] to {new_value}: {process}\") time.sleep(.1) # Give other processes a chance to rum # For platforms that use *spawn*, such as windows: if __name__ == '__main__': processing() Prints: Put Leader type: 1 Process 8764 is setting props['lead_type'] to 2: blah Process 23740 is setting props['lead_type'] to 1: blah Process 15276 is setting props['lead_type'] to 2: blah Process 8984 is setting props['lead_type'] to 1: blah Process 18300 is setting props['lead_type'] to 2: blah Process 10740 is setting props['lead_type'] to 1: blah Process 17796 is setting props['lead_type'] to 2: blah Process 7880 is setting props['lead_type'] to 1: blah Original Posting A few observations: Your current code will result in all of your children processes except for one never terminating: You need to put N instances of 'ends' to the queue where N is the number of child processes you are creating so that each process knows that there is no more data. Right now you have only put a single instance of 'ends' on the queue so only one child process can get it and the others will wait indefinitely doing a blocking get against an empty queue. You can greatly simplify the code and use a standard dictionary by using a multiprocessing pool, e.g. a militprocessing.Pool. The idea is to have the main process initialize the props dictionary and then initialize within each pool process' address space a global variable pool initialized appropriately. Alternatively, you could pass the props dictionary as an an argument to processes. Of course, in your current code you could have also passed it as additional argument. Multiprocessing will perform worse unless function processes is sufficiently CPU-intensive. from multiprocessing import Pool def init_pool_processes(the_props): \"\"\" Initialize global variable props for each pool process. \"\"\" global props props = the_props def user_choices(): props = {'deep': 0} lead_type = input('Put Leader type: ') props['lead_type'] = int(lead_type) return props def processing(): props = user_choices() processors = [ 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah' ] with Pool(initializer=init_pool_processes, initargs=(props,)) as pool: pool.map(processes, processors) def processes(process): print(f\"Lead {props['lead_type']}: {process}\") # For platforms that use *spawn*, such as windows: if __name__ == '__main__': processing() If you want to use individual multiprocessing.Process instances then a simpler approach would be to use a multiprocessing.JoinableQueue with daemon child processes. from multiprocessing import Process, cpu_count, JoinableQueue def user_choices(): props = {'deep': 0} lead_type = input('Put Leader type: ') props['lead_type'] = int(lead_type) return props def processing(): props = user_choices() processors = [ 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah' ] queue = JoinableQueue() for p in processors: queue.put(p) for _ in range(cpu_count()): # A daemon process will terminate automatically when the main # process terminates: Process(target=processes, args=(queue, props), daemon=True).start() # Wait for all queue items to have been processed: queue.join() def processes(queue, props): while True: process = queue.get() print(f\"Lead {props['lead_type']}: {process}\") queue.task_done() # Show we have finished processing the item # For platforms that use *spawn*, such as windows: if __name__ == '__main__': processing() If you use a multiprocessing.Queue instance, then you need to put N sentinel items (where N is the number of child processes) on the queue that signify there is no more data to be gotten from the queue. I think that using None is a better choice of a sentinel value than 'ends' as it could not possibly be mistaken for actual data: from multiprocessing import Process, cpu_count, Queue def user_choices(): props = {'deep': 0} lead_type = input('Put Leader type: ') props['lead_type'] = int(lead_type) return props def processing(): props = user_choices() processors = [ 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah' ] queue = Queue() n_processors = cpu_count() for p in processors: queue.put(p) for _ in range(n_processors): # Use None as the sentinel so it cannot be mistaken for actual data: queue.put(None) procs = [Process(target=processes, args=(queue, props)) for _ in range(n_processors)] for p in procs: p.start() for p in procs: p.join() def processes(queue, props): while True: process = queue.get() if process is None: # Sentinel break print(f\"Lead {props['lead_type']}: {process}\") # For platforms that use *spawn*, such as windows: if __name__ == '__main__': processing() All three code examples above result in the following output: Put Leader type: 1 Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah Lead 1: blah\n",

      "You can surely create a dictionary and share it among the threads, but you should protect each access to the dictionary (be it read or write) with a lock. Here lock would work but I am trying to find a more natural way to solve it. The usage of synchronization primitives such as locks is the natural way to implement a reliable architecture involving concurrency. That being said, making sure that a certain request is not made twice can be approached on various levels. If you are doing it with a dictionary like described, you need to insert the identifier right before performing the request. Pseudo code: with lock.acquire(): if url in d: return # do not perform request d.[url] = True perform_request(url) If the request failed, you might want to remove the key from dict again (not without acquiring the lock, of course).\n",

      "You cannot usefully do this with threads in Python (at least not the CPython implementation you're probably using). The Global Interpreter Lock means that, instead of the near-800% efficiency you'd like out of 8 cores, you only get 90%. But you can do this with separate processes. There are two options for this built into the standard library: concurrent.futures (http://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) and multiprocessing (http://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html). In general, futures is simpler in simple cases and often easier to compose; multiprocessing is more flexible and powerful in general. futures also only comes with Python 3.2 or later, but there's a backport for 2.5-3.1 at PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures). One of the cases where you want the flexibility of multiprocessing is when you have a big shared data structure. See Sharing state between processes (http://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes) and the sections directly above, below, and linked from it for details. If your data structure is really simple, like a giant array of ints, this is pretty simple: class MyClass(object): def __init__(self, giant_iterator_of_ints): self.big_shared_object = multiprocessing.Array('i', giant_iterator_of_ints) def compute_heavy_task(self): lock = multiprocessing.Lock() def subtask(my_range): return some_expensive_task(self.big_shared_object, lock, my_range) pool = multiprocessing.pool.Pool(5) my_ranges = split_into_chunks_appropriately(len(self.big_shared_object) results = pool.map_async(subtask, my_ranges) pool.close() pool.join() Note that the some_expensive_task function now takes a lock object—it has to make sure to acquire the lock around every access to the shared object (or, more often, every \"transaction\" made up of one or more accesses). Lock discipline can be tricky, but there's really no way around it if you want to use direct data sharing. Also note that it takes a my_range. If you just call the same function 5 times on the same object, it'll do the same thing 5 times, which probably isn't very useful. One common way to parallelize things is to give each task a sub-range of the overall data set. (Besides being usually simple to describe, if you're careful with this, with the right kinds of algorithms, you can even avoid a lot of locking this way.) If you instead want to map a bunch of different functions to the same dataset, you obviously need some collection of functions to work on, rather than just using some_expensive_task repeatedly. You can then, e.g., iterate over these functions calling apply_async on each one. But you can also just turn it around: write a single applier function, as a closure around the data, that takes takes a function and applies it to the data. Then, just map that function over the collection of functions. I've also assumed that your data structure is something you can define with multiprocessing.Array. If not, you're going to have to design the data structure in C style, implement it as a ctypes Array of Structures or vice-versa, and then use the multiprocessing.sharedctypes stuff. I've also moved the result object into results that just get passed back. If they're also huge and need to be shared, use the same trick to make them sharable. Before going further with this, you should ask yourself whether you really do need to share the data. Doing things this way, you're going to spend 80% of your debugging, performance-tuning, etc. time adding and removing locks, making them more or less granular, etc. If you can get away with passing immutable data structures around, or work on files, or a database, or almost any other alternative, that 80% can go toward the rest of your code.\n",

They aren't always more efficient than the regular loopy way, and almost always less readable when you're writing anything more complicated than one or two nested loops. So let's get a multi-line solution first. Once we have a working solution, we can try to convert it to a one-liner. Now the solution you shared in the comments works, but it doesn't handle duplicate elements and also is O(n^2) because it contains a nested loop. https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) list_common = [x[1] for x in list1 for y in list2 if x[1] == y[1]] A few key things to remember: A single loop O(n) is better than a nested loop O(n^2). Membership lookup in a set O(1) is much quicker than lookup in a list O(n). Sets also get rid of duplicates for you. Python includes set operations like union, intersection, etc. Let's code something using these points: # Create a set containing all numbers from list1 set1 = set(x[1] for x in list1) # Create a set containing all numbers from list2 set2 = set(x[1] for x in list2) # Intersection contains numbers in both sets intersection = set1.intersection(set2) # If you want, convert this to a list list_common = list(intersection) Now, to convert this to a one-liner: list_common = list(set(x[1] for x in list1).intersection(x[1] for x in list2)) We don't need to explicitly convert x[1] for x in list2 to a set because the set.intersection() function takes generator expressions and internally handles the conversion to a set. This gives you the result in O(n) time, and also gets rid of duplicates in the process.\n",

      "Why does the nio.file package in Java 7 exhibit sluggish performance when generating new files?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The documentation of FileChannel (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#transferTo-long-long-java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel-) transferTo states: \"Many operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the filesystem cache to the target channel without actually copying them.\" So the code you have written is correct, and the inefficiency you are seeing is probably related to the underlying file-system type. One small optimization I could suggest would be to open the file in append (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#open-java.nio.file.Path-java.util.Set-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-) mode. \"Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent\" Beyond that, you may have to think of a way to work around the problem. For example, by creating a large enough contiguous file as a first step. EDIT: I also noticed that you are not explicitly closing your FileOutputStream. It would be best to hang on to that and close it, so that all the File Descriptors are closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lets start from the basis: your application is I/O-bound. You are not suffering bad performance due to object allocation, or memory, or CPU limits. Your application is running slowly because of disk access. If you think you can improve file access, you might need to resort to lower-level programming using the JNI. File access can be improved if you handle it more efficiently by yourself, and that will need to be done on a lower level. I am not sure that using java.nio will give you better performance by magnitude which you are looking for, although it might give you some more freedom in doing CPU/memory intensive operations while I/O is running. The reason being is that basically, java.nio wraps the file reading with a selector, letting you be notified when a buffer is read for use, indeed giving you the asynchronous behavior which might help your performance a bit. But reading the file itself is your bottleneck, and java.nio doesn't give you anything in that area. So try it out first, but I wouldn't keep my hopes too high for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your case : File[] listFiles = directory.listFiles(); will create 1000 File objects but these are not expensive I/O operations as new File() doesn't perform IO operations while creating objects as FileInputStream do. But note that you can all the same avoid creating all Files object in one time and reducing the consumed memory by streaming the walking files. Files.newDirectoryStream(Path dir) (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#newDirectoryStream-java.nio.file.Path-) that returns a DirectoryStream<Path> and Files.list(Path dir) (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#list-java.nio.file.Path-) that returns a Stream<Path> provide ways to achieve that. Here's (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33668859/files-newdirectorystream-vs-files-list) a post pointing out some differences between them. So you could get the same result with the java.nio API in this way : Path directory = ...; Files.newDirectoryStream(directory) .forEach(p -> { try { String fileName = p.getFileName().toString(); String filePath = p.toAbsolutePath().toString(); long fileLen = Files.size(p); long filelastModified = Files.getLastModifiedTime(p).toMillis(); } catch (IOException e) { // FIXME to handle } }); Edit for comment : What if there are sub-directories & there is a need to retrieve the details of files inside the sub-directories too? In this case Files.walk() is more suitable as it is recursive. It is very close to : Path directory = ...; Files.walk(directory) .forEach(p -> { try { // same code .... } catch (IOException e) { // FIXME to handle } });\n",
      "\n",
      "What you are seeing is pretty much normal behavior, its not java-specific. When a file is created, the file system needs to add a file entry to its structures, and in the process modify existing structure (e.g. the directory the file is contained in) to take note of the new entry. On a typical harddisk this requires some head movements, a single seek takes time in the order of milliseconds. On the other hand, once you start writing to the file, the file system will assign new blocks to the file in a linear fashion (as long as possible), so you can write sequential data with about the maximum speed the drive can handle. The only way to make major improvements in speed is use a faster device (e.g. an SSD drive). You can pretty much observe this effect everywhere, Windows explorer and similar tools all show the same behavior: large files are copied with speeds close to the devices limits, while tons of small files go painfully slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are using an API that will create/open/close a file (handle) for each write operation. And you are surprised that this doesn't give you optimal performance?! That utility method might be convenient, but heck, instead of going loop: try: open file; write to file; close file open file; write to file; close file Consider doing something along the lines of open file loop: try: write to open file write to open file close file instead. Of course, that means that you will have to write more code; making things more complicated; but well: one has to balance \"super-easy to read\" code with \"performing good enough\" code sometimes. Probably the most rework could go even go like: StringBuilder toWrite = ... loop: try: toWrite.append(...) toWrite.append(...) and then, after the loop, you use FileUtils.write() in order to simply write the whole content (that you collected within memory) in one single shot to the file system. That should keep the overall complexity of your new code at a reasonable level; but help with better end-to-end performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to merge two or more files efficiently you should ask yourself, why on earth are you using char based Reader and Writer to perform that task. By using these classes you are performing a conversion of the file’s bytes to characters from the system’s default encoding to unicode and back from unicode to the system’s default encoding. This means the program has to perform two data conversion on the entire files. And, by the way, BufferedReader and BufferedWriter are by no means NIO2 artifacts. These classes exists since the very first version of Java. When you are using byte-wise copying via real NIO functions, the files can be transferred without being touched by the Java application, in the best case the transfer will be performed directly in the file system’s buffer: import static java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption.*; import java.io.IOException; import java.nio.channels.FileChannel; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.Paths; public class MergeFiles { public static void main(String[] arg) throws IOException { if(arg.length<2) { System.err.println(\"Syntax: infiles... outfile\"); System.exit(1); } Path outFile=Paths.get(arg[arg.length-1]); System.out.println(\"TO \"+outFile); try(FileChannel out=FileChannel.open(outFile, CREATE, WRITE)) { for(int ix=0, n=arg.length-1; ix<n; ix++) { Path inFile=Paths.get(arg[ix]); System.out.println(inFile+\"...\"); try(FileChannel in=FileChannel.open(inFile, READ)) { for(long p=0, l=in.size(); p<l; ) p+=in.transferTo(p, l-p, out); } } } System.out.println(\"DONE.\"); } }\n",
      "\n",
      "I see a number of potential performance improvements. One is to use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer; it's source-compatible but more performant because it's unsynchronized. A second (much more important) would be to use FileChannel and the java.nio API instead of FileInputStream -- or at least, wrap the FileInputStream in a BufferedInputStream to optimize the I/O.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this in a directory which already contains a lot of files? If so, you may well just be seeing the penalty for having a lot of files in a directory - this varies significantly by operating system and file system. Otherwise, what are you actually doing while you're creating the files? Where does the data come from? Are they big files? One thing you might want to do is try writing to a ByteArrayOutputStream instead - that way you can see how much of the activity is due to the file system and how much is just how you're obtaining/writing the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottleneck is most likely in opening the files, and there's not a lot you can do about it. (The Q&A linked in the comments suggests using a memory mapped file. But this directly contradicts the Javadoc (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#map%28java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,%20long,%20long%29) which states that the overheads of setting up the mapping are significant, and you are only going to get a pay-off for large files. And a bit of math shows that his benchmark uses files with an average size of 5642 bytes ... which is huge compared to your file size of 29 bytes.) The only way you will get traction on this is if you combine the little files into a big one using a light-weight format that can be read / loaded efficiently. ZIP is not the best idea unless you avoid compression.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "The sluggish performance observed when generating multiple files using the nio.file package in Java 7 can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, each call to `Files.createFile()` results in a separate file creation operation, which involves metadata updates and file system overhead. This can lead to increased latency, especially when dealing with numerous small files. Secondly, the `transferTo` method mentioned in the context may not always provide optimal performance due to variations in file system implementations across different operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, consider the following optimizations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Batch File Creation**: Instead of creating files one by one, batch multiple file creations together. For instance, you can create a temporary file, write all required data into it, and then split it into individual files later. This reduces the number of file creation operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use Direct Buffers**: Utilize direct buffers (`ByteBuffer`) for writing data to files. Direct buffers bypass the JVM heap, allowing for faster writes to the file system. However, ensure proper handling of these buffers to avoid memory management issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Avoid Unnecessary File Metadata Updates**: Minimize metadata updates by using `Files.newTemporaryFile()` or `Files.newTempFile()` methods to create temporary files. These methods allow you to specify custom attributes such as permissions and ownership, reducing the need for subsequent metadata updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Optimize File Size**: If feasible, increase the size of the files being created. Larger files generally benefit from better sequential I/O performance on most modern file systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Utilize File Channel**: Instead of relying solely on `Files.createFile()`, consider using `FileChannel` for file operations. It provides additional control over I/O operations and can offer performance benefits, especially for larger files or high-throughput scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consider Using a Memory Mapped File**: For extremely large datasets, consider using memory-mapped files. Although the setup overhead might be significant, the payoff can be substantial for large files. Be cautious, though, as excessive usage of memory-mapped files may introduce additional complexities and resource constraints.\n",
      "\n",

      "Ok, we finally got it. Deeply buried in our ever growing build.sbt there was this nice snippet: // Name of the produced artifact artifactName := { (sv: ScalaVersion, module: ModuleID, artifact: Artifact) => artifact.name + \"-\" + module.revision + \".\" + artifact.extension } It came from one of the very, very first stages of our transition to sbt as build tool back in 2013. It might even be that it was from the official Play or sbt tutorial back then (Play 2.1, sbt 0.12...). It survived until today. And it caused the <project>-<version>-assets.jar containing the assets below public/ to be falsely named <project>-<version>.jar.

      "\n",
      "1. **Artifact Naming Issue**:\n",
      "   The `artifactName` setting in your `build.sbt` was causing the assets JAR to be overwritten by the main application JAR. This issue arises because the assets JAR was being named incorrectly, leading to conflicts when both JARS were packaged together.\n",

      "   artifactName := {}\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "2. **sbt-play-ebean Plugin Version Incompatibility**:\n",
      "   You mentioned that version 4.0.1 of sbt-play-ebean is not compatible with Scala 2.12 and sbt 1.x. To resolve this, you should upgrade the plugin to a compatible version. As per your reference, versions 4.1.0 or 4.0.6 are suitable alternatives.\n",

      "I think there's a couple of ways that are easier to accomplish than writing your own converter. You can use boost::python's map_indexing_suite to do the conversion for you, or you can use keyword arguments in python. I personally prefer keyword arguments, as this is the more \"Pythonic\" way to do this. So this is your class (I added a typedef for the map): typedef std::map<std::string, double> MyMap; class myClass { public: // Constructors - set a-f to default values. void SetParameters(MyMap &); private: double a, b, c, d, e, f; }; Example using map_indexing_suite: #include <boost/python/suite/indexing/map_indexing_suite.hpp> using boost::python; BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(mymodule) { class_<std::map<std::string, double> >(\"MyMap\") .def(map_indexing_suite<std::map<std::wstring, double> >() ); class_<myClass>(\"myClass\") .def(\"SetParameters\", &myClass::SetParameters); } Example using keyword arguments. This requires using a raw_function wrapper: using namespace boost::python; object SetParameters(tuple args, dict kwargs) { myClass& self = extract<myClass&>(args[0]); list keys = kwargs.keys(); MyMap outMap; for(int i = 0; i < len(keys); ++i) { object curArg = kwargs[keys[i]]; if(curArg) { outMap[extract<std::string>(keys[i])] = extract<double>(kwargs[keys[i]]); } } self.SetParameters(outMap); return object(); } BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(mymodule) { class_<myClass>(\"myClass\") .def(\"SetParameters\", raw_function(&SetParameters, 1)); } this allows you to write stuff like this in Python: A.SetParameters(a = 2.2, d = 4.3, b = 9.3)\n",

      "I have found a nice solution: added a template that can convert a Python dictionary to std::map. The logic is based on this extremely useful primer (https://misspent.wordpress.com/2009/09/27/how-to-write-boost-python-converters/), with slight modifications mostly obtained from this source file (http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx_sources/scitbx/stl/map_wrapper.h) and some additional comments. Below is the template definition: // dict2map.hh #include \"boost/python.hpp\" namespace bpy = boost::python; /// This template encapsulates the conversion machinery. template<typename key_t, typename val_t> struct Dict2Map { /// The type of the map we convert the Python dict into typedef std::map<key_t, val_t> map_t; /// constructor /// registers the converter with the Boost.Python runtime Dict2Map() { bpy::converter::registry::push_back( &convertible, &construct, bpy::type_id<map_t>() #ifdef BOOST_PYTHON_SUPPORTS_PY_SIGNATURES , &bpy::converter::wrap_pytype<&PyDict_Type>::get_pytype #endif ); } /// Check if conversion is possible static void* convertible(PyObject* objptr) { return PyDict_Check(objptr)? objptr: nullptr; } /// Perform the conversion static void construct( PyObject* objptr, bpy::converter::rvalue_from_python_stage1_data* data ) { // convert the PyObject pointed to by `objptr` to a bpy::dict bpy::handle<> objhandle{ bpy::borrowed(objptr) }; // \"smart ptr\" bpy::dict d{ objhandle }; // get a pointer to memory into which we construct the map // this is provided by the Python runtime void* storage = reinterpret_cast< bpy::converter::rvalue_from_python_storage<map_t>* >(data)->storage.bytes; // placement-new allocate the result new(storage) map_t{}; // iterate over the dictionary `d`, fill up the map `m` map_t& m{ *(static_cast<map_t *>(storage)) }; bpy::list keys{ d.keys() }; int keycount{ static_cast<int>(bpy::len(keys)) }; for (int i = 0; i < keycount; ++i) { // get the key bpy::object keyobj{ keys[i] }; bpy::extract<key_t> keyproxy{ keyobj }; if (! keyproxy.check()) { PyErr_SetString(PyExc_KeyError, \"Bad key type\"); bpy::throw_error_already_set(); } key_t key = keyproxy(); // get the corresponding value bpy::object valobj{ d[keyobj] }; bpy::extract<val_t> valproxy{ valobj }; if (! valproxy.check()) { PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, \"Bad value type\"); bpy::throw_error_already_set(); } val_t val = valproxy(); m[key] = val; } // remember the location for later data->convertible = storage; } }; In order to use it, you must create a Dict2Map instance so that its constructor gets invoked. One possible way of doing it is to create a static Dict2Map<key_t, val_t> variable in the source file where you define the Python wrappers. Using my example: // myclasswrapper.cc #include \"mymap.hh\" #include \"dict2map.hh\" // register the converter at runtime static Dict2Map<char, double> reg{}; #include \"boost/python.hpp\" // not really necessary namespace bpy = boost::python; // wrapping MyClass bpy::class_<MyClass>(\"MyClass\", \"My example class\", bpy::init<mymap_t>() ) // .def(...method wrappers...) ; Now it is possible to create MyClass objects on the Python side like this: myclass = MyClass({\"foo\":1, \"bar\":2}) Edit: Python lists can be converted to C++ std::vector-s in an analogous manner. Here is the corresponding template: template<typename elem_t> struct List2Vec { /// The type of the vector we convert the Python list into typedef std::vector<elem_t> vec_t; /// constructor /// registers the converter List2Vec() { bpy::converter::registry::push_back( &convertible, &construct, bpy::type_id<vec_t>() #ifdef BOOST_PYTHON_SUPPORTS_PY_SIGNATURES , &bpy::converter::wrap_pytype<&PyList_Type>::get_pytype #endif ); } /// Check if conversion is possible static void* convertible(PyObject* objptr) { return PyList_Check(objptr)? objptr: nullptr; } /// Perform the conversion static void construct( PyObject* objptr, bpy::converter::rvalue_from_python_stage1_data* data ) { // convert the PyObject pointed to by `objptr` to a bpy::list bpy::handle<> objhandle{ bpy::borrowed(objptr) }; // \"smart ptr\" bpy::list lst{ objhandle }; // get a pointer to memory into which we construct the vector // this is provided by the Python side somehow void* storage = reinterpret_cast< bpy::converter::rvalue_from_python_storage<vec_t>* >(data)->storage.bytes; // placement-new allocate the result new(storage) vec_t{}; // iterate over the list `lst`, fill up the vector `vec` int elemcount{ static_cast<int>(bpy::len(lst)) }; vec_t& vec{ *(static_cast<vec_t *>(storage)) }; for (int i = 0; i < elemcount; ++i) { // get the element bpy::object elemobj{ lst[i] }; bpy::extract<elem_t> elemproxy{ elemobj }; if (! elemproxy.check()) { PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, \"Bad element type\"); bpy::throw_error_already_set(); } elem_t elem = elemproxy(); vec.push_back(elem); } // remember the location for later data->convertible = storage; } };\n",

      "You would rather have something that affects just the sub menus, my approach would be to give the sub menu a class name, and then have the hover event binding only on that but enact the changes on the child sub-menu. I gave each main menu item a menu-item class attribute and a sub-menu to the children without too much alteration of your javascript, just on the selectors that you are using to get the elements to bind your events to. Our basic structure: Menu: 1. Item 1 (no sub-menu) 2. Item 2 (has a sub-menu) a. sub-menu item 1 (no sub-menu) b. sub-menu item 2 (has a sub-menu) i. sub-sub-menu item 1 ii. sub-sub-menu item 2 3. Item 3 (has a sub-menu) a. sub-menu item 1 (no sub-menu) b. sub-menu item 2 (has a sub-menu) HTML (Simplified) <ul id=\"top-level-menu\"> <li class='menu-item'> No Sub Menu </li> <li class='menu-item'> Nested Sub Menu <ul class='sub-menu'> <li class='menu-item'> Nested Menu <ul class='sub-menu'> <li> Nested </li> <li> Sub </li> <li> Menu </li> </ul> </li> <li> no nested list </li> </ul> </li> <li class='menu-item'> Regular Sub menu <ul class='sub-menu'> <li> Sub item 1 </li> <li> Sub item 2 </li> </ul> </li> </ul> The CSS portions exists just to hide the .sub-menus on initialization, and style for showing them on the right of the element, the latter of which could be set up however you wish. CSS .sub-menu { display: none; } /* optional and replaceable with similar logic for display */ .show-sub-menu-on-right { position: absolute; left: 100% !important; /* make sure to override inherited positioning*/ top: 0%; } Now for the jQuery we just need to apply the bindings to the correct elements. We want the li.menu-item to show their children of class sub-menu, so we set up our function to do just that. javascript/jQuery $('.menu-item').hover( function() { var subMenu = $(this).children('.sub-menu'); $(subMenu).fadeIn() }, function() { var subMenu = $(this).children('.sub-menu'); $(subMenu).fadeOut(); } ) I believe this is what you're after? Below is the above logic applied to your case. EDIT: Here is the jsfiddle, modded from the one you provided, which shows what you want, I also added one CSS class .show-sub-menu-on-right just for visual effect. even more updated jsfiddle with all the fixings (http://jsfiddle.net/6dApS/3/) EDIT 2 Example with sub-sub-menus (http://jsfiddle.net/uvm75/) and how it can apply to nested menus. EDIT 3 Example with slide out and down menus (http://jsfiddle.net/47R3C/1/) The real code that i added is in the javascript, I moved put it here for reference. The main thing is to switch all the .menu-item that are children of a submenu to sub-menu-item Basically the logic is similar. The same as before, we just declare a class .sub-menu-item and give these elements different bindings for hover behavior. We want to get all the children li, then we assert a few things on the list because now the animation is in our hands. $('.sub-menu-item').hover( // When mouse enters the .navigation element function () { //Fade in the navigation submenu var subMenu = $(this).children('.sub-menu'); // Get the sub menu if (!subMenu) { return; // if it doesn't have a sub menu quit } var subMenuItems = $(subMenu).children('li'); // get all the sub menu items // Get the max width we need to expand the menu to var maxWidth = 0; for (var i = 0; i < subMenuItems.length; i++) { if ( maxWidth < $(subMenuItems[i]).width() ) { maxWidth = $(subMenuItems[i]).width(); } } var firstItem = $(subMenuItems).first(); // get the first item var restOfItems = subMenuItems.slice(1); // slice of the rest. $(firstItem).width(0); // make sure the element has width 0 so we can animate it $(subMenu).show(); // make the submenu ul itself is visible $(subMenuItems).each(function () { // Make sure all the items in the ul $(this).css('display', 'none'); // are not yet visible }); $(firstItem).show(); // make the first item visible $(firstItem).animate({ // animate the first item growing width:maxWidth+\"px\", },function() { // function to execute after animation is complete $(restOfItems).slideDown(); // slide down the rest of the list }); }, // When mouse leaves the .navigation element function () { //Fade out the navigation submenu var subMenu = $(this).children('.sub-menu'); $(subMenu).fadeOut(); // fadeOut will hide the sub cat menu } ); If you are looking for a generic way to handle this you here is a skeleton: HTML <ul class='menu'> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-1'> <ul class='sub-menu'> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-1'> <ul class='sub-menu'> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-1'>A</li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-4'>B</li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-7'>C</li> </ul> </li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-4'>B</li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-7'>C</li> </ul> </li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-2'> <ul class='sub-menu'> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-1'> <ul> <li>AA</li> </ul> </li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-1'>B</li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-1'>C</li> </ul> </li> <li class='menu-item-with-animation-style-3'> <ul class='sub-menu'> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>C</li> </ul> </li> </ul> javascript: $('.menu-item-with-animation-style-1').hover( fadeInFunctionforStyle1, fadeOutFunctionforStyle1, ); $('.menu-item-with-animation-style-2').hover( fadeInFunctionforStyle2, fadeOutFunctionforStyle2, ); $('.menu-item-with-animation-style-1').hover( fadeInFunctionforStyle1, fadeOutFunctionforStyle1, ); // .... $('.menu-item-with-animation-style-N').hover( fadeInFunctionforStyleN, fadeOutFunctionforStyleN, ); See the last menu item (\"International\") in the \"Mixed Bag\" drop down for an Example of even more extendability (http://jsfiddle.net/47R3C/3/)\n",

What I came up with is a function that detects if an li is the current target (while the mouse is somewhere inside the ul). If the current target is not an li it means that our ul is active but no children are being hovered. I toggle a class accordingly.

      "1. Assign unique classes to each main menu item and their corresponding sub-menus. For example, use `menu-item` for main menu items and `sub-menu` for sub-menus.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Apply CSS to hide the sub-menus initially and define their display properties when hovered over the main menu item.\n",

      "  top: 0%;\n",
      "}\n",

      "1. matplotlib.pyplot.subplots() From the documentation page on matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(): This utility wrapper makes it convenient to create common layouts of subplots, including the enclosing figure object, in a single call. That means you can use this single function to create a figure with several subplots with only one line of code. For example, the code below will return both fig which is the figure object, and axes which is a 2x3 array of axes objects which allows you to easily access each subplot: fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=3) 2. matplotlib.pyplot.subplot() In contrast, matplotlib.pyplot.subplot() creates only a single subplot axes at a specified grid position. This means it will require several lines of code to achieve the same result as matplot.pyplot.subplots() did in a single line of code above: # first you have to make the figure fig = plt.figure(1) # now you have to create each subplot individually ax1 = plt.subplot(231) ax2 = plt.subplot(232) ax3 = plt.subplot(233) ax4 = plt.subplot(234) ax5 = plt.subplot(235) ax6 = plt.subplot(236) or you can also use built-in method of fig: ax1 = fig.add_subplot(231) ax2 = fig.add_subplot(232) ax3 = fig.add_subplot(233) ax4 = fig.add_subplot(234) ax5 = fig.add_subplot(235) ax6 = fig.add_subplot(236) Conclusion The code above can be condensed with a loop, but it is still considerably more tedious to use.

If you want to create several data series all you need to do is: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.figure() x=[[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]] y=[[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5],[3,4,5,6],[7,8,9,10]] plt.plot(x[0],y[0],'r',x[1],y[1],'g',x[2],y[2],'b',x[3],y[3],'k') You could automate it by having a list of colours like ['r','g','b','k'] and then just calling both entries in this list and corresponding data to be plotted in a loop if you wanted to. If you just want to programmatically add data series to one plot something like this will do it (no new figure is created each time so everything is plotted in the same figure): import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x=[[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]] y=[[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5],[3,4,5,6],[7,8,9,10]] colours=['r','g','b','k'] plt.figure() # In this example, all the plots will be in one figure. for i in range(len(x)): plt.plot(x[i],y[i],colours[i]) plt.show() If anything matplotlib has a very good documentation page (http://matplotlib.org/) with plenty of examples (http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html). 17 Dec 2019: added plt.show() and plt.figure() calls to clarify this part of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, long explanation because there are multiple issues here. The biggest problem you are running into is that there are multiple ways to handle things in matplotlib. In fact, there are effectively multiple interfaces. The easiest and most commonly used method is to just create your plot using pyplot and its methods like pyplot.subplot and pyplot.plot. This can work well for quick plots, but will not work well for your situation. Since you want to create two figures and alternate plotting to those figures, you are going to want to use the more powerful objects in pyplot. You have gotten part way there yourself, but I'll try to help you with the last part. You are good up until here: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt nr = [10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50] fig1 = plt.figure(1) fig2 = plt.figure(2) for y in range(len(nr)): m = np.arange(y+1) n = (y+1)*np.arange(y+1) but when you try to use the methods of Figure, you are getting confused and trying to use similar methods that belong to pyplot. The next portion should be rewritten as: ax1 = fig1.add_subplot(3,2,y) ax1.plot(m,n, 'b') ax1.set_title('y=%s'%y) m1 = np.square(np.arange(y+1)) n1 = (y+1)*np.arange(y+1) ax2 = fig2.add_subplot(3,2,y) ax2.plot(m1,n1, 'r') ax2.set_title('y=%s'%y) Here, what you have done is capture the Axes instance that is returned from add_subplot(). Then you plot onto the Axes instance. Also, when specifying where you want the subplot to be placed (the third input to Figure.add_subplot()), you do not want to use y+1 because that would start at 1 and end at 6 which would go out of the available range of 0-5. Remember that Python indices start with zero. Finally, to show the figures you just created, you can either call pyplot.show() like this: plt.show() or you can save the figures to files like this: fig1.savefig('fig1.png') fig2.savefig('fig2.png') The resulting figures look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "You can create multiple plots next/below each other via plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1). Take a look at the documentation (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) for examples. If you want to create multiple plots in one, you could share the x or y axis via ax.twinx() or ax.twiny().\n",
      "\n",
      "The usual way to create plots with matplotlib would be to create some axes first and then plot to those axes. The axes can be set up on a grid using plt.subplots, figure.add_subplot, plt.subplot2grid or more sophisticated, using GridSpec. Once those axes are created, they can be given to functions, which plot content to the axes. The following would be an example where 6 axes are created and 3 different functions are used to plot to them. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec import numpy as np def func1(ax, bx, cx): x = np.arange(3) x2 = np.linspace(-3,3) y1 = [1,2,4] y2 = [3,2.5,3.4] f = lambda x: np.exp(-x**2) ax.bar(x-0.5, y1, width=0.4) ax.bar(x, y2, width=0.4) bx.plot(x,y1, label=\"lab1\") bx.scatter(x,y2, label=\"lab2\") bx.legend() cx.fill_between(x2, f(x2)) def func2(ax, bx): x = np.arange(1,18)/1.9 y = np.arange(1,6)/1.4 z = np.outer(np.sin(x), -np.sqrt(y)).T ax.imshow(z, aspect=\"auto\", cmap=\"Purples_r\") X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-3,3),np.linspace(-3,3)) U = -1-X**2+Y V = 1+X-Y**2 bx.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, color=U, linewidth=2, cmap=\"autumn\") def func3(ax): data = [sorted(np.random.normal(0, s, 100)) for s in range(2,5)] ax.violinplot(data) gs = gridspec.GridSpec(3, 4, width_ratios=[1,1.5,0.75,1], height_ratios=[3,2,2] ) ax1 = plt.subplot(gs[0:2,0]) ax2 = plt.subplot(gs[2,0:2]) ax3 = plt.subplot(gs[0,1:3]) ax4 = plt.subplot(gs[1,1]) ax5 = plt.subplot(gs[0,3]) ax6 = plt.subplot(gs[1:,2:]) func1(ax1, ax3, ax5) func3(ax2) func2(ax4, ax6) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/N0oRj.png)\n",

      "There are a few things incorrect with your approach. First is your use of the radio buttons in the HTML. For you to easily grab their individual click events and inspect their value, you want to add id attributes to them. I added some id's myself based on the radio button's name attribute that you already added. Second, the jQuery which you used I changed completely to match thew use of the id attribute which I just added. This will look to see which radio button we just clicked on and if it matches the id of the radio button which will show the element, then we show the element accordingly. You can also accomplish show/hide via CSS. I removed your CSS class of display: none; for the above to work, but you can keep it and use jQuery's toggleClass (https://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/) or addClass and removeClass using the above logic.

      "\n",
      "To extract only the beginning and end of a pandas group while omitting the central portion, you can use the `groupby` function along with `head` or `tail`. However, since you want to omit the central portion, we'll use a combination of both `head` and `tail`. Here's how you can do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "# Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'c1' is the column you're grouping by\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This code will create a new DataFrame where each group is represented by the first and last row of the original group. The `reset_index(drop=True)` part is used to remove the old index and create a new one starting from 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to include the group label ('c1' in this case) in the resulting DataFrame, you can modify the code like this:\n",

      "result = df.groupby('c1').apply(lambda x: pd.concat([x.head(1), x.tail(1)])).reset_index()\n",
      "```\n",

However, as it has been pointed out in the comments, you could use streams to reach a fair compact way to initialize your two-dimensional array from a single-dimension one. Basically, you could define your matrix's dimension from the array's length and then rely on a stream to copy the array's elements within the two-dimensional array. double[] x = new double[]{1, 2, 3}; double[][] x2D = new double[x.length][1]; IntStream.range(0, x.length).forEach(i -> x2D[i][0] = x[i]); Or in a more concise writing, you could immediately initialize your two-dimensional array with a stream where each element is mapped to a double[] and then collect each one of them into a further array. double[] x = new double[]{1, 2, 3}; double[][] mat = Arrays.stream(x).mapToObj(i -> new double[]{i}).toArray(double[][]::new);\n",

      "\n",
      "The issue in your code is with the add() method of the LinkedList class. The add() method should be responsible for adding a new node to the beginning of the linked list, but your implementation is not doing that correctly. In your add() method, the assignment self._head = node is outside the method's block and is not properly indented. This causes the method to only set the _head attribute once, to the node that is passed to the first call to add(). All subsequent calls to add() do not update the _head attribute and do not add the new node to the beginning of the linked list. To fix this issue, you need to indent the assignment statement so that it is part of the add() method's block. Here is the corrected implementation: class Node: def __init__(self, value): self._value = value self._next = None class LinkedList: def __init__(self): self._head = None def add(self, node): node._next = self._head self._head = node def copy(self): current = self._head new_list = LinkedList() while current != None: new_list.add(Node(current._value)) current = current._next return new_list\n",

That is something different. You can define a method: def insert_node(self, node): node.nextnode = self.head self.head = new_node Nevertheless this will create a loop since now node1 will be pointing to node2 and node2tonode1`. So the resulting linked list will be a rounded list with two elements, like: node1 --> node2 ^---------/ EDIT: since you solved that one. There is also a problem with your delmid method. The main problem is that in your while loop you need to walk through the linked list, and you do not do that: current always remains the same, so: def delmid(ll, n): current = ll.head if current == n: print('Can\\'t delete first node') return while current.nextnode: if current.nextnode == n: if current.nextnode.nextnode: current.nextnode = current.nextnode.nextnode return else: print('Can\\'t delete last node') return current = current.nextnode Should fix that.\n",

      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering is due to the incorrect handling of the head node during insertion operations in your linked list implementation. Specifically, in your `add()` method, you're not properly updating the `_head` attribute of the `LinkedList` class. Instead, you're assigning the new node to `_head` outside the method's scope, which results in only the first node ever being assigned as the head, causing subsequent insertions to fail to update the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this, ensure that the assignment of the new node to `_head` is done within the `add()` method's block, so that each call to `add()` updates the head accordingly. Here's how you can correct the `add()` method:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class LinkedList:\n",
      "    def __init__(self):\n",
      "        self._head = None\n",
      "\n",
      "    def add(self, node):\n",
      "        # Ensure the new node points to the current head\n",
      "        node._next = self._head\n",
      "\n",
      "        # Update the head to point to the new node\n",
      "        self._head = node\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, each time you call `add()`, the new node becomes the head of the linked list, and the linked list grows correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the issue you mentioned about circular references occurring when inserting nodes might stem from not properly managing the `next` pointers between nodes. Ensure that each node's `next` pointer correctly points to the next node in the sequence, and not back to a previously established node, unless intended to form a circular structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the primary cause of the problem is the mismanagement of the `_head` attribute in the `add()` method, leading to improper insertion behavior. By ensuring that the assignment of the new node to `_head` is handled within the method's scope, you can rectify this issue and maintain the integrity of your linked list.\n",

      "What is the rationale behind String.indexOf returning -1 instead of throwing an exception when a substring is absent?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The indexOf method returns the index of the searched string. If the string is not found, it returns -1. That's why you have that comparison, it's to make sure that the searched string is found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because -1 is itself a valid index. It could use a different value, such as None, but that wouldn't be useful, which -1 can be in other situations (thus str.find()), and would amount simply to error-checking, which is exactly what exceptions are for.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has always been annoying ;-) Contrary to one answer, there's nothing special about -1 with respect to strings; e.g., >>> \"abc\"[-1] 'c' >>> [2, 3, 42][-1] 42 The problem with find() in practice is that -1 is in fact not special as an index. So code using find() is prone to surprises when the thing being searched for is not found - it was noted even before Python 1.0.0 was released that such code often went on to do a wrong thing. No such surprises occur when index() is used instead - an exception can't be ignored silently. But setting up try/except for such a simple operation is not only annoying, it adds major overhead (extra time) for what \"should be\" a fast operation. Because of that, string.find() was added in Python 0.9.9 (before then, only string.index() could be used). So we have both, and that persists even into Python 3. Pick your poison :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a common idiom in languages where the types do not include range checks. An \"out of bounds\" value is used to indicate one of several conditions. Here, the return value indicates two things: 1) was the character found, and 2) where was it found. The use of -1 for not found and a non-negative index for found succinctly encodes both of these into one value, and the fact that not-found does not need to return an index. In a language with strict range checking, such as Ada or Pascal, the method might be implemented as (pseudo code) bool indexOf(c:char, position:out Positive); Positive is a subtype of int, but restricted to non-negative values. This separates the found/not-found flag from the position. The position is provided as an out parameter - essentialy another return value. It could also be an in-out parameter, to start the search from a given position. Use of -1 to indicate not-found would not be allowed here since it violates range checks on the Positive type. The alternatives in java are: throw an exception: this is not a good choice here, since not finding a character is not an exceptional condition. split the result into several methods, e.g. boolean indexOf(char c); int lastFoundIndex();. This implies the object must hold on to state, which will not work in a concurrent program, unless the state is stored in thread-local storage, or synchronization is used - all considerable overheads. return the position and found flag separately: such as boolean indexOf(char c, Position pos). Here, creating the position object may be seen as unnecessary overhead. create a multi-value return type such as class FindIndex { boolean found; int position; } FindIndex indexOf(char c); although it clearly separates the return values, it suffers object creation overhead. Some of that could be mitigated by passing the FindIndex as a parameter, e.g. FindIndex indexOf(char c, FindIndex start); Incidentally, multiple return values were going to be part of java (oak), but were axed prior to 1.0 to cut time to release. James Gosling says (http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c_family_interview.htm) he wishes they had been included. It's still a wished-for feature (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4222792). My take is that use of magic values are a practical way of encoding a multi-valued results (a flag and a value) in a single return value, without requiring excessive object creation overhead. However, if using magic values, it's much nicer to work with if they are consistent across related api calls. For example, // get everything after the first c int index = str.indexOf('c'); String afterC = str.substring(index); Java falls short here, since the use of -1 in the call to substring will cause an IndeOutOfBoundsException. Instead, it might have been more consistent for substring to return \"\" when invoked with -1, if negative values are considered to start at the end of the string. Critics of magic values for error conditions say that the return value can be ignored (or assumed to be positive). A consistent api that handles these magic values in a useful way would reduce the need to check for -1 and allow for cleaner code.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the inability to find the string constitutes an error, an exceptional condition, then you should throw some exception to the caller. E.g., throw new RuntimeException(\"String not found\"); If the inability to find the string is a normal situation that the caller would want to handle in the normal flow of the code, then you should use a special return value. For this type of search method, no normal return value could be negative, and the convention is to return -1, as String.indexOf (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf-java.lang.String-) and List.indexOf (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html#indexOf-java.lang.Object-) do. If you follow that convention you could actually implement your method body with a single line: return java.util.Arrays.asList(text).indexOf(s); Note: That change treats null a bit differently. There are three things that could be null in your method: the search string, the array, and the elements of the array. Your current code throws a NullPointerException if passed a null array, or when it encounters a null element, but silently ignores a null search string. By deferring to List.indexOf, all the array elements are allowed to be null too, allowing for searching for a null value within the array. It's probably a harmless difference here, but a well-designed method considers such questions. For example, you might prefer to treat a null search string as invalid input and immediately throw an exception in that case. A fully documented public method would also consider the case of multiple matching elements within the array: should it return the lowest matching index, or any matching index? If any index is acceptable, must it consistently return the same index for repeat invocations with the same arguments? (A hypothetical multithreaded search implementation could easily defeat the \"obvious\" assumption of returning the lowest index, because you can't predict which CPU core will find a match first.) Also consider that the method could be declared static.\n",

      "The indexing syntax mystr[-1] gives you the last element of mystr, but that is a convenience of the indexing syntax. When you use find() you get a number counting from zero, so 2 in this case.

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The rationale behind `String.indexOf` returning `-1` instead of throwing an exception when a substring is absent is rooted in several design principles and historical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistency with Indexing Syntax**: In many programming languages, including Java, the indexing syntax `string[index]` allows access to characters starting from `0`. Using `-1` to indicate \"not found\" aligns with this zero-based indexing scheme, making the API intuitive and consistent with existing language conventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Error Handling vs. Normal Flow Control**: Throwing an exception for a missing substring would elevate a common, expected operation (searching for a substring) to an exceptional condition. This can disrupt the normal flow of control in the calling code, potentially leading to more complex error handling and reduced readability. By returning `-1`, the method adheres to a convention that allows the caller to handle the absence of a substring gracefully without resorting to exception handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Performance Considerations**: Exceptions, especially in performance-critical applications, come with a cost. The overhead associated with exception handling (stack unwinding, etc.) can be significant, especially in tight loops or frequently called methods. Returning `-1` avoids this overhead, making the method faster and more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multi-purpose Return Value**: The return value of `-1` serves dual purposes:\n",
      "   - It indicates whether the substring was found (`-1` means not found, any other value means found).\n",
      "   - It provides the index of the found substring.\n",
      "\n",
      "   This dual functionality simplifies the API by avoiding the need for separate methods or additional parameters to convey both pieces of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Historical Context**: The decision to use `-1` for \"not found\" predates modern exception-oriented programming paradigms. Early versions of Java (and similar languages) emphasized simplicity and directness in APIs, favoring return values over exceptions for error reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Avoiding Surprises**: As noted in the context, using a dedicated return value like `-1` prevents unexpected behavior that could arise from misinterpreting the result of a method that returns an index. For instance, if `String.find()` returned an index, a naive implementation might mistakenly interpret `-1` as a valid index, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect logic\n",

      "The first thing i can recommend is to change the locations of your files, cause in Maven you have to follow some conventions (http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html): The Java files should be put into src/main/java plus the appropriate package name. The hibernate.cfg.xml file and the hibernate.reveng.xml do NOT belong to src/main/java they have to be located into src/main/resources plus the appropriate package name you like to put them into. Furthermore in hibernate the mapping should be handled by annotations and not by hbm files anymore. But if you have to stuck with the mappings files they have to be put into src/main/resources as well. If you have some kind of tests (usually unit tests) like Test.java they have to be put into src/test/java any kind of resources which belong to the unit tests only have to be put into src/test/resources plus the appropriate package name. The jsp file have been located correctly into src/main/webapp. Apart from the above you have to call the correct method in your HibernateDao.java line 11 where you are trying to call a method openSession which obviously does not exists.\n",

      "\n",
      "As stated Alex Funk in the comments: java do not find org/hibernate/cfg/Configuration when trying to execute new Configuration The problem is that the dependency is not packed into the jar file. Then, if you don't specify the .jar in the classpath and provide it at runtime, the JVM will not be able to create or access instances of classes of the dependency. In this case, the error indicates that the class org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration is not found. So you have two approaches: Approach 1. Create a jar with the dependencies (Bigger .jar but recommended) To do this you must override the maven assembly plugin and configure it the following way: <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.3.0</version> <executions> <execution> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>single</goal> </goals> <configuration> <descriptorRefs>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRefs> <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> </plugins> Then you can generate the jar via: mvn install Approach 2. Add the hibernate into the .jar classpath and provide it on runtime I do not recommend this approach because it breaks one of the main advantages of plugins. The user will have to download the library and place it in a lib folder in its server. So the plug-in will require more installation steps by the end-user instead or just 'plugging in' the plugin in the server plugins folder. The maven configuration will be: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId> <configuration> <archive> <manifest> <addClasspath>true</addClasspath> <classpathPrefix>lib/</classpathPrefix> <mainClass>com.example.MainClass</mainClass> </manifest> </archive> </configuration> </plugin> Then in the server, users will have to provide the library jar into a lib folder inside the plugins folder: MyServer |--- plugins | |--- lib | |--- hibernate-core-5.4.18.Final.jar | |--- YourPlugin-1.0.0.jar |--- spigot-1.16.1.jar ... other server files and folders Then execute: mvn install Let me know if this solves your problem!\n",

      "There are two problems, I found them already. The first one is here (extra prefix should be removed) Indeed. So I'll skip this one. How to instruct this plugin to compile java classes beforehand? Not possible (but the other way around would be, i.e. running the plugin after compile, as we'll see). The fact is that the Hibernate3 Maven Plugin, which predates annotations, has been initially designed to deal with hbm.xml mapping files. And that's why hibernate3:hbm2ddl (http://mojo.codehaus.org/maven-hibernate3/hibernate3-maven-plugin/hbm2ddl-mojo.html) invokes the execution of the lifecycle phase process-resources prior to executing itself. When using annotation instead of XML files for the mappings, the goal would indeed have to run after the compile phase (the process-classes (http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference) phase would be a natural candidate) but that's not the current behavior of hibernate3:hbm2ddl. So you'll have to run compile before invoking the goal: mvn compile hibernate3:hbm2ddl The other option would be to bind the hibernate3:hbm2ddl on the build lifecycle, e.g. on process-classes: <project> ... <build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate3-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.2</version> <executions> <execution> <phase>process-classes</phase><!-- compile would also work --> <goals> <goal>hbm2ddl</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> </plugin> </plugins> </build> ... </project> And then just run process-classes to trigger the plugin: mvn process-classes\n",

      "The convention is to generate code in target/generated-sources/<generator> so in your case, I would generate sources in target/generated-sources/hibernate3 (it's sad the hibernate3 plugin doesn't follow this convention by default). Anyway, things should work and actually, the POM I posted in this previous answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2848567/how-to-configure-hbm2java-and-hbm2dao-to-add-packagename-to-generated-classes/2852173#2852173) does (I re-ran my sample project and it definitely works). Could you be a victim of MHIBERNATE-104 (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MHIBERNATE-104)? Honestly, I'm confused. As a workaround, you could use the Build Helper Maven Plugin (http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/) and its build-helper:add-source (http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/add-source-mojo.html) goal to add your directory as source directory. See the Usage (http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/usage.html) page for a configuration example. I'm using exactly the pom you proposed here, just not plugged into the default build lifecycle (without executions). That must be the cause of the problem: if hibernate3:hbm2java isn't part the build lifecycle, it doesn't get the opportunity to register the output directory as source folder. So Maven isn't aware of it during the \"normal build\" and will just ignore it.\n",

(You'll need the jQuery cookie plugin (https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/) loaded to get $.cookie() and $.removeCookie().) $(function() { // $() is an alternative syntax for $(document).ready() if ($.cookie('t4hidden')) { // Update page if cookie is set $('#top4hide').hide(); $('#top4trigger i').toggleClass('fa-chevron-up fa-chevron-down'); } $(\"#top4trigger\").click(function() { // Click handler for link $(\"i\", this).toggleClass(\"fa-chevron-up fa-chevron-down\") $(\"#top4hide\").toggle(\"blind\", function () { // Set/delete cookie after animation complete if ($(\"#top4hide\").is(\":hidden\")) { $.cookie(\"t4hidden\", \"foo\"); } else { $.removeCookie(\"t4hidden\"); } }); }); });\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue occurs in the following block: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery(function($) { $(\".fluid\").hide(); $(\".fixed\").click(function() { $(\"#mainwidth\").animate({width: \"1024px\"}, 800); $(this).hide(); $(\".fluid\").show(); $.cookie(\"width\",\"fixed\", {expires: 365}); return false; }); $(\".fluid\").click(function() { $(\"#mainwidth\").animate({width: \"95%\"}, 800); $(this).hide(); $(\".fixed\").show(); $.cookie(\"width\",\"fluid\", {expires: 365}); return false; }); if($.cookie(\"width\") == \"fixed\") { $(\".fixed\").hide(); $(\".fluid\").show(); $(\"#mainwidth\").css(\"width\",\"1024px\"); }; }); </script> lets have a look at the last statement: if($.cookie(\"width\") == \"fixed\") { $(\".fixed\").hide(); $(\".fluid\").show(); $(\"#mainwidth\").css(\"width\",\"1024px\"); }; it instructs the browser to change the width when page loads. if the width cookie value is \"fixed\", then set width to 1024px. however, what happens if the page reloads while the cookie value is \"fluid\" ? when you click the logo, it reloads the page. hence, if the cookie value is fluid, the width will not be set to the relevant value. just add another block of code to handle the situation where the cookie value is \"fluid\" and it will work fine. if($.cookie(\"width\") == \"fixed\") { $(\".fixed\").hide(); $(\".fluid\").show(); $(\"#mainwidth\").css(\"width\",\"1024px\"); } else if($.cookie(\"width\") == \"fluid\") { $(\".fluid\").hide(); $(\".fixed\").show(); $(\"#mainwidth\").css(\"width\",\"95%\"); };\n",

      "I'd combine that into one function, e.g. like this: $(function() { // Create a variable for the current state var body_class; // Cache some elements var $body = $('body'), $switch = $('.toggle-swap'); // Define a function that toggles background + button var toggleBodyClass = function(event) { // Toggle the images if (body_class) { $switch[0].src = $switch[0].src.replace(\"switch_off.png\",\"switch_on.png\"); body_class = ''; } else { $switch[0].src = $switch[0].src.replace(\"switch_on.png\",\"switch_off.png\"); body_class = 'clicked'; } // Toggle some css classes (body + button) $body.toggleClass('clicked'); $switch.toggleClass('on'); // Update the cookie $.cookie('body_class', body_class); // Prevent the browsers default behavior if (event) event.preventDefault(); }; // Set the initial state if ($.cookie('body_class')) { toggleBodyClass(); } // Bind the event handler $switch.click(toggleBodyClass); });\n",

      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "try like this, data attribute contains the data to be sent to the server, you have to pass it as key/value pairs $.ajax({ type:\"POST\", url:\"delete.php\", data:{id:db_id}, success:function(){} });\n",
      "\n",
      "data should be data: {'item' : item} $(\".do-delete\").click(function() { var item = $(this).attr(\"data-id\"); $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: \"../assets/includes/ajax/delete-item.php\", data: {'item' : item}, cache: true, success: function(data) { $(\".test\").append(data); // alert(\"De categorie met zijn respectievelijke onderdelen zijn verwijdert.\"); } }); });\n",
      "\n",
      "The variable idis indeed undefined in the context of the event handler function. We need to get the information from somewhere else. As the delete action is triggered by a click on a .delete element in your #contact-list you should get the id to be deleted directly from that element. And, indeed, it can be found there: <a href='' class='delete' data-id='${response[i]._id}'>Del</a> The data-id holds the id as received from the AJAX server earlier. It can be referenced by looking at the .dataset.id attribute of the clicked element e.target. So, your .on(\"click\", \".delete\", function (e) {...} should look something like this: $(\"#contact-list\").on(\"click\", \".delete\", function (e) { e.preventDefault(); if (confirm(\"Do you want to delete this item?\")){ var settings = { \"async\": true, \"crossDomain\": true, \"url\": `https://example-95e6.restdb.io/rest/studentcrud/${e.target.dataset.id}`, \"method\": \"DELETE\", // delete based on ID \"headers\": { \"content-type\": \"application/json\", \"x-apikey\": APIKEY, \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\" } $.ajax(settings).done(function (response) { console.log(response); //update our table getContacts(); }); } })\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is with your data parameter not being a valid JSON payload. It is not valid JSON, because jQuery is using the jQuery.param() method internally to prepare the request parameters for typical POST submissions, and it will get converted to the following string: adrId=6 However, the server is expecting a JSON payload, and what you specified is clearly not a JSON payload. A valid JSON payload would be: { 'adrId': 6 } One approach to send correct JSON in the data parameter is to refactor your jQuery AJAX to look like this: $.ajax({ url: '/Home/DeletePost', type: 'POST', data: \"{ 'adrId': 6 }\", dataType: 'json', contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8', error: function (xhr) { alert('Error: ' + xhr.statusText); }, success: function (result) { alert(\"success\"); }, async: true, processData: false }); Or you can use JSON.stringify as suggested by others. An alternative approach would be to send your data as 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' which is the default, and that way you don't have to change your data parameter. The code would be much simplified: $.ajax({ url: '/Home/DeletePost', type: 'POST', data: { adrId: 6 }, error: function (xhr) { alert('Error: ' + xhr.statusText); }, success: function (result) { alert(\"success\"); }, async: true }); JQuery will recognize that the result is valid JSON.\n",

      "\n",
      "Make the following change and it should work. In the success callback this is the jqXHR object, therefore you have to cache this before the ajax call: delete.click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); var that = $(this); $.post(\"url.php\", {'data': dataId}, function(response) { if (response == true) { alert(\"IT WORKED\"); that.closest(container).remove(); } }, \"json\" ); });\n",
      "\n",
      "You have extra } in url. Remove it. {{url('/deleteNews')}} Also you need to add CSRF too. Otherwise you will get HttpException. Add this meta to head tag: <meta name=\"csrf-token\" content=\"{{ csrf_token() }}\"> And before ajax request add this: $.ajaxSetup({ headers: { 'X-CSRF-TOKEN': $('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').attr('content') } }); So your script must be: <script> function del_click(data){ //alert(data); var request = new XMLHttpRequest(); $.ajaxSetup({ headers: { 'X-CSRF-TOKEN': $('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').attr('content') } }); $.ajax({ type :\"POST\", url :\"{{url('/deleteNews')}}\", dataType:\"json\", data :{ data:data }, success :function(response) { alert(\"thank u\"); }, error: function(e) { console.log(e.responseText); } }); } </script>\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not building your data property correctly: you are sending a string like id=3 which cannot be parsed as JSON so you get a server error. So you just need to fix your data: you need to crate an object with the keys of the parameter names of controller your action and you need to use the JSON.stringify method to turn it into a proper JSON string: $.ajax({ type:'POST', url: \"../../user/DeleteConfirmed\", dataType: \"json\", contentType: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\", data: JSON.stringify({ id: entryId }) });\n",

      "How to facilitate interaction between a controller and a directive in AngularJS?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many way to set up a communication between your children and your parent directive: Bidirectional binding (like you said) Registration of your children in your parent. You can use the directive require property and the last parameter of the link function controllers to register a children in his parent. Events, see $scope.on/broadcast Angular services (as they are \"singletons\", it's very easy to use it to share data between your directives) etc. Example for 2: angular.module('Example', []) .directive('parent', [function () { return { controller: function (){ // registerChildren etc } // ... }; }]) .directive('children', [function () { return { require: ['^^parent', 'children'], controller: function (){ // ... } link: function ($scope, element, attributs, controllers) { ParentController = controllers[0]; OwnController = controllers[1]; ParentController.registerChildren(OwnController); // ... } // ... }; }])\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what you are missing here is the notion of scopes in angularjs and how they are passed. when you declare your directive like this: app.directive('parent', [function(){ return { controller: function($scope) { $scope.variable = {}; // init $scope.variable.value = \"foo\"; } } }]); app.directive('child', [function(){ return { controller: function($scope) { // here you are directly using the parent's scope // so you can access $scope.variable directly // without sending it in the function $scope.changeObj = function(replacement) { $scope.variable.value = replacement ; }; } } }]); you are basically telling angular to use the parent scope as scope, because you are not defining a special scope for your directive. (btw, this kind of operations: scope.changeObj = function(obj) { obj.value = \"hhuhu\" }; should not be in the link function but in the controller, it looks like controller logic to me : ) The second thing you can do is send the variable through a parameter to the child scope, as follows: app.directive('parent', [function(){ return { controller: function($scope) { $scope.variable = {}; // init $scope.variable.value = \"foo\"; } } }]); app.directive('child', [function(){ return { scope:{myVariable: '='}, controller: function($scope) { // here you are directly using the child's scope // but since you have defined double binding, // changing this in the child will also update the parent $scope.changeObj = function(replacement) { $scope.myVariable.value = replacement ; }; } } }]); <body ng-controller=\"MainCtrl\"> <div test my-variable=\"variable\" ng-click=\"changeObj('some text')\">{{ variable.value }}</div> </body> I hope it's clear now\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that you can use element attributes to pass properties from the parent directive controller's scope to a child. function parentCtrl () { this.greeting = 'Hello world!'; } function myParentDirective () { return { scope: {}, controller: 'parentCtrl', controllerAs: 'ctrl', template: '<my-child greeting=\"ctrl.greeting\"></my-child>' } } function childCtrl () {} function myChildDirective () { return { scope: { greeting: '=' }, bindToController: true, controller: 'childCtrl', controllerAs: 'ctrl', template: '<p>{{ ctrl.greeting }}</p><input ng-model=\"ctrl.greeting\" />' } } angular.module('parent', []) .controller('parentCtrl', parentCtrl) .directive('myParent', myParentDirective); angular.module('child', []) .controller('childCtrl', childCtrl) .directive('myChild', myChildDirective); angular.module('app', ['parent', 'child']);\n",
      "\n",
      "The good way If you're using Angular >=1.5 you can use the require syntax in combination with the controllerAs syntax, so instead of using the scope to access the parent, you use a direct reference to the parent which is created by angular, when you explicitly require another directive. For example: angular.module(\"test\", []) .directive(\"foo\", function() { return { restrict: \"E\", scope: {}, bindToController: true, controllerAs: \"fooController\", controller: function() { var controller = this; controller.something = \"Foo Initial Value\"; controller.setSomething = function(something) { controller.something = something; console.log(\"Foo Changed:\" + something); } } } }) .directive(\"bar\", function() { return { scope: {}, restrict: \"E\", require: { \"parent\": \"^^foo\" }, controllerAs: \"barController\", template: \"Bar <a href='' ng-click='barController.parent.setSomething(\\\"from template\\\")'>Change directly on parent</a>\", bindToController: true, controller: function() { var controller = this; this.$onInit = function() { // We can access the parent after the $onInit. console.log(controller.parent.something); } } } }); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.0/angular.js\"></script> <body ng-app=\"test\"> <foo> <bar></bar> </foo> </body> In this example, the bar directive requires the foo controller, which will get binded to the parent property of the bar controller. The Not-So-Good way I do not like this way, since the directive's are tied together by the coincidence of they being used in the proper order. angular.module(\"test\", []) .directive(\"foo\", function() { return { restrict: \"E\", scope: true, controller: [\"$scope\", function($scope) { $scope.something = \"Foo Initial Value\"; $scope.setSomething = function(something) { $scope.something = something; console.log(\"Foo Changed:\" + something); } }] } }) .directive(\"bar\", function() { return { scope: true, restrict: \"E\", template: \"Bar <a href='' ng-click='setSomething(\\\"from template\\\")'>Change directly on parent</a> Something: {{something}}\" } }); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.0/angular.js\"></script> <body ng-app=\"test\"> <foo> <bar></bar> </foo> </body> From my experience, I recommend using the ControllerAs syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is possible by having the parent controller talk to the child controller through a well defined API, that you create. The idea is that you want to maintain loose coupling between the parent and the child directive by having each respective controller knowing as little about each other as possible, but still have enough knowledge to get the job done. To achieve this, require the parent directive from the child directive, and let the child directive register itself with parent's controller: Child directive: require: '^parentDirective', controller: function(){ this.someFunc = function() {...} }, link: function(scope,element,attr, parentCtrl){ parentCtrl.register(element); } Then in your parent directive, implement the register function, and get the child's controller, and call the child's function when needed: Parent directive: controller: function(){ var childCtrl = undefined; this.register = function (element) { childCtrl = element.controller(); } this.callChildFunc = function (){ childCtrl.someFunc(); } }, link: function (scope,element){ var ctrl = element.controller(); ctrl.callChildFunc(); }\n",

You can do this using a common technique for directive-to-directive communication, where the child directive gains access to the parent directive's controller: Parent Dir: angular.module('myApp').directive('parentDir', function() { return { restrict: 'E', link: function (scope, element, attributes) { element = //some HTML code }, controller: function ($scope, $element) { this.elem = function () { return $element; } } } }); Child Directive: angular.module('myApp').directive('childDir', function() { return { restrict: 'E', require: '^parentDir', link: function (scop, elmn, attr, parentCtrl){ var parentElmn = parentCtrl.elem(); } } });\n",
      "\n",
      "$scope might not be around, but bindings sure will. You have two main options: Use a service and set this piece of data on there, then watch it in the child directive. This will work, but I do feel like it harms composition and re-use since you can no longer have multiple instances of the directive (they would all depend on the singleton service). Use an isolate scope as you mentioned earlier and then watch the binding using an '&' expression. This will be the closest you're going to get to Angular2 without using something like ngForward since the flow of data from parent -> child is still the primary method of data-binding in Angular2. This is the preferred way to accomplish this imo even if it ends up being more verbose. No matter what solution you choose, make sure that you don't leak memory; if you don't unbind that $rootScope.$on handler, then you will leak memory every time that an instance of the directive is created and subsequently destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can set a template property on the parent and inside the template use the child directive. It should ideally render automatically. Something like: angular .module('app', []) .directive('parentDirective', parentDirective) .directive('childDirective', childDirective); function parentDirective() { return { restrict: 'E', scope: true, template: '<div>{{job}} is seen<child-directive></child-directive></div>' //template: 'My job is {{job}}', controller: function($scope) { $scope.job = 'trashman'; $scope.say = function(job) { $scope.job = job; alert($scope.job); } } }; } function childDirective() { return { restrict: 'E', template: '<div>I will be renderred</div>', link: function(scope) { scope.say('shoe shine boy'); } }; } Now you can use the parent directive anywhere and it will render the child directive inside it as well. Something like: <parent-directive></parent-directive> Angular will now see it like this, parent directive found, render it, inside it is a child directive used, render the child's html.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a directive can't have the kind of parent controllers that you're thinking of, a directive actually has parent directives. And each directive can have a controller if you specify it. A directive is a parent of another if that is the case in the html. <div parent-directive> <div child-directive></div> </div> In the parent directive's controller you need to define whatever you want to access on this. Then require: 'parent-directive' And link: function (scope, element, attrs, parent) Setting require to an array will result in an array being passed into the linking function. Optional controllers may be null. Note you can also reference sibling directives as well. But you can't reference yourself (the same instance, that is).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of ways you can do this. I'll give a couple of examples: 1. The Easy (and Non-Ideal) Way Access the parent scope within the directive: Instead of: scope.reset = function() {}; use: scope.$parent.reset = function() {}; But modifying the parent scope from within a child scope is not a great practice. It can lead to confusion about the way scope inheritance works (What are the nuances of scope prototypal / prototypical inheritance in AngularJS? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14049480/what-are-the-nuances-of-scope-prototypal-prototypical-inheritance-in-angularjs)). Also, IMO, it is not great encapsulation. 2. A (Slightly) Better Way <button ng-click=\"buttonClicked = true\"> <div ng-controller=\"anotherController\" class=\"container\"> <directive data=\"{{ datafordirective }}\" reset=\"buttonClicked\" reset-callback=\"buttonClicked = false\"></directive> </div> Here we are using an attribute in the parent scope (buttonClicked) to control the directive through attributes on the element. app.directive('directive', function(){ return { restrict: 'AE', scope:{ data: '=', resetCallback: '&', reset: '='}, link: function(scope, element, attrs){ scope.$watch('reset', function(val) { if (val) { // reset dataset scope.resetCallback(); } }); } }; The directive binds the value of buttonClicked to reset, then watches for that value to change, resetting the dataset when it does. 3. Another Better Way Create a service to handle operations on your dataset. app.service('dataset', function() { this.reset = function() { // reset dataset }; }); Then, somewhere in the parent controller, you need to inject the dataset service and create a function to call dataset.reset: $scope.reset = function() { dataset.reset(); };\n",

      "The KEYDOWN event occurse only once, when the key is pressed (see pygame.event (https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html)). Use pygame.key.get_pressed() (https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed) to get the current state of the keys in each frame. Increase the speed in x direction (x1_dir) if a or d is pressed and decrease it if no one of the keys is pressed. Increase the speed in y direction (y1_dir) if w or s is pressed and decrease it if no one of the keys is pressed. e.g.: while True: screen.fill(colorBlack) for event in pygame.event.get(): #Game Exit if event.type== QUIT: pygame.quit() sys.exit() if event.type==KEYDOWN: if event.key==K_d: x1_right=True if event.type==KEYUP: if event.key==K_d: x1_right=False keys = pygame.key.get_pressed() if keys[K_d] or keys[K_a]: x1_dir += 0.1 if keys[K_d] else -0.1 else: x1_dir *= 0.98 if keys[K_w] or keys[K_s]: y1_dir += 0.1 if keys[K_s] else -0.1 else: y1_dir *= 0.98 For a smooth movement you have to use floating point values.

      "Your main problem is that you check for the pressed keys inside your event loop: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False # only executed if there's an event returned by pygame.event.get() # and possible executed multiple times per frame key = pygame.key.get_pressed() if key[K_UP]: ... Therefore, your code that does the movement (if key[K_UP]: ...) is only executed when there's currently an event in the queue. Just move this code outside the event handler loop: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False # always executed every frame key = pygame.key.get_pressed() if key[K_UP]: ... IMHO a better way to handle your movement is to use vectors, since they make it easy to ensure a constant movement speed and it's much less code. Here's a simple example: import pygame def main(): pygame.init() screen = pygame.display.set_mode((500, 500)) clock = pygame.time.Clock() dt = 0 movement = { pygame.K_UP: ( 0, -1), pygame.K_DOWN: ( 0, 1), pygame.K_LEFT: (-1, 0), pygame.K_RIGHT: ( 1, 0) } pos = pygame.Vector2((100, 100)) while True: events = pygame.event.get() for e in events: if e.type == pygame.QUIT: return pressed = pygame.key.get_pressed() # calculate the movement vector move = pygame.Vector2() for dir in (movement[key] for key in movement if pressed[key]): move += dir if move.length() > 0: move.normalize_ip() # ensure we have a constant speed pos += move * dt/5 screen.fill(pygame.Color('grey')) pygame.draw.circle(screen, pygame.Color('dodgerblue'), [int(x) for x in pos], 20, 0) pygame.display.update() dt = clock.tick(60) if __name__ == '__main__': main()\n",

      "I think this is a problem with your loops. In a pygame loop: while True: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: pygame.quit() pygame.display.update() As you can see, it is an infinite loop. Then, the problem happens in here: running = True while running: if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if pygame.key == pygame.K_UP: my_change = -15 With this, you create another infinite loop within the main loop. So, this code will never get to updating you pygame window (as it is stuck in the nested loop). Remember, updating in pygame should go in a single operation only. As that operation will be repeated for every loop in the main game loop. Try revising your code with this in mind. The way it is now, your code will not work no matter how we arrange it. Tip: For character motion, creating a class to handle your character, and adding a function for it to update it's position is the most common approach in my opinion. Possible fix: Move running outside the event loop. Then, add running as another check in your keydown event. running = True while True: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: pygame.quit() if running and event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if pygame.key == pygame.K_UP: my_change = -15 my += my_change pygame.display.update()\n",

The above code is for OUTSIDE your while loop. Your event for loop will need to be changed slightly, to improve your code, I recommend putting functions into play here, or using dictionaries to rid the need of all these if statements but I won't just for my answer being simpler and get the point across. I am leaving out some details, like event.quit, since you already have them. If you don't include the keyup part, your character will never stop moving! for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == KEYDOWN: if event.key == K_w: moving_up = True if event.key == K_d moving_right = True if event.key == K_s: moving_down = True if event.key == K_a: moving_left = True if event.type == KEYUP: if event.key == K_w: moving_up = False # .. repeat this for all 4.

That causes the exec to be applied in the context of the load_module method — not the new_module; so specify the context: exec(self._modules[fullname], new_module.__dict__) However, using a Python versioned 3.4 or higher, you become subject to PEP 451 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0451/) (the introduction of module specs (https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module-spec)), as well as the deprecation of the imp (https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html) module, in favor of importlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html).

An abstract base class for meta path finder objects is supplied: importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder. And such finder objects now use find_spec rather than find_module. Here is a very close reimplementation of the code sample. import importlib import sys import types class StringLoader(importlib.abc.Loader): def __init__(self, modules): self._modules = modules def has_module(self, fullname): return (fullname in self._modules) def create_module(self, spec): if self.has_module(spec.name): module = types.ModuleType(spec.name) exec(self._modules[spec.name], module.__dict__) return module def exec_module(self, module): pass class StringFinder(importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder): def __init__(self, loader): self._loader = loader def find_spec(self, fullname, path, target=None): if self._loader.has_module(fullname): return importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec(fullname, self._loader) if __name__ == '__main__': modules = { 'my_module': \"\"\" BAZ = 42 class Foo: def __init__(self, *args: str): self.args = args def bar(self): return ', '.join(self.args) \"\"\"} finder = StringFinder(StringLoader(modules)) sys.meta_path.append(finder) import my_module foo = my_module.Foo('Hello', 'World!') print(foo.bar()) print(my_module.BAZ)\n",

The python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module) have more information on this function.

You add your component (JButton) without a 2nd parameter when adding with GridLayout. If the layout should be 3 x 10, you'll want to add 30 components to this container. You're adding another JPanel,panel1, to the GridLayout-using JPanel, and it will become part of the grid. It doesn't seem like you want to do this.

      "Use the any() function (http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#any) with a generator expression to find if there is any dictionary value that contains your item: if any(someList[0] in v for v in someDictionary.itervalues()): # item found Use someDictionary.values() on Python 3. The generator expression loops over the dictionary values (without producing a list of all values first) and tests against each value, one by one as the generator expression is iterated over. any() only tests elements from the generator expression until one is True, and then stops looping, making this relatively efficient. If you need to have the key of the matching value, use next(): next((k for k, v in someDictionary.iteritems() if someList[0] in v), None) which returns either the matching key, or None in no match is found.\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a simple search function for dictionaries in Python, you can follow these steps using the `any()` function along with a generator expression for efficiency. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define your dictionary:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "mydict = {'apple': [1, 2, 3], 'banana': [4, 5, 6], 'cherry': [7, 8, 9]}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Create a function to perform the search:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def find_item(search_value, dictionary):\n",
      "    # Use any() with a generator expression to check if the search_value is in any of the dictionary values\n",
      "    return any(search_value in value for value in dictionary.values())\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Call the function with the desired search value:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "print(find_item(5, mydict))  # Output: True\n",
      "print(find_item(10, mydict)) # Output: False\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to get the key of the matching value instead of just a boolean result, you can modify the function like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def find_key(search_value, dictionary):\n",
      "    # Find the first key with the search_value in its corresponding value\n",
      "    return next((k for k, v in dictionary.items() if search_value in v), None)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Call the modified function with the desired search value:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "print(find_key(5, mydict))  # Output: banana\n",
      "print(find_key(10, mydict)) # Output: None\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "These functions are efficient because they utilize generators and the `any()` function, which stop searching once a match is found.\n",

      "This will have to do with the HTML parsing. By specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/lists.html#h-10.2), lists may only contain <li> elements and nothing else. So, your browser will build a different DOM, e.g. by wrapping the headings into list items (HTML5 wil specify what exactly to do with invalid HTML). Use your DOM inspector to view the actual DOM tree (context menu -> Inspect element).\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll find that a <h1> (http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/h1.html) cannot contain another heading (the only valid content of an h1, and other headings, is phrasing content (http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/terminology.html#phrasing-content), which restricts content to, very simplistically, in-line elements and text), therefore when the browser constructs the DOM it moves the h2 elements outside of the h1, which prevents them being found, by the DOM, inside the h1. In Chrome, your HTML is reorganised to the following (and, I presume, similarly rearranged in other browsers): <h1 id=\"hg\"></h1> <h2>11</h2> <h2>22</h2> <h2>33</h2> This rescuing of the DOM to maintain validity is why we should, as developers, always strive to create valid HTML: because the automatic corrections made by browsers are undocumented and unpredictable (prior to HTML 5, which I think documents how error recovery should proceed). Incidentally, this sounds very similar to the use-case presented for the <hgroup> (http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/hgroup.html#hgroup) element (which seems to be in the process of being dropped from the spec). Given, however, that you appear to be presenting a list of contents I'd suggest enclosing the <h2> elements in an <ol> and semantically grouping them that way: <ol id=\"contents\"> <li><h2>11</h2></li> <li><h2>22</h2></li> <li><h2>33</h2></li> </ol>\n",

      "The trouble with modern browsers is that they don't require valid HTML. And nowadays tags are parsed as they are encountered without strict checking. So any script (or any tag element, for that matter) that is before the <head> section but still within the <html> section is treated as part of the <head> section of the document, and whatever is present in the <head> tag in the document is kept in <head> if only valid tags are present, and is pushed to body if text or invalid tags are found. Such scripts, as long as they do not reference the <head> tag will be fine (since the head tag has changed now). This is the normal, but unexpected behaviour, and can change between browsers and even their versions. As browsers evolved they began to accept files and structures deviating from strict standards. You can verify this by using the Developer Console (F12) in Chrome on this document: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <script> console.log(document.getElementsByTagName('title')); </script> <head> <title>This</title> as <script>var s=\"sastra\";console.log(s); </script><title>This2</title> as </head> <body> <a href=\"http://google.com\">Click here for Google</a> <p> How are you?</p> </body> </html> and calling document.getElementsByTagName('html') and viewing their head and body elements and comparing it with the source. In the same document above, if the 2 'as' are removed from within the <head> section, I mean this: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <script> console.log(document.getElementsByTagName('title')); </script> <head> <title>This</title> <script>var s=\"sastra\";console.log(s); </script><title>This2</title> </head> <body> <a href=\"http://google.com\">Click here for Google</a> <p> How are you?</p> </body> </html> you will see that the head and body are now different using the same Developer Console.

      "Well, in modern Chrome, it's at least possible to know what happens. Chrome uses the HTML5 parser algorithm which describes exactly how invalid mark-up is processed. The gory details are at http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/tree-construction.html#parsing-main-inbody (http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/tree-construction.html#parsing-main-inbody) What happens in your example is that the first <head> in <body> is discarded. Then the <script src=\"javascriptfile.js\"/> tag is processed, which is a start tag, not a self-closing tag, so everything that follows, including everything that looks like a tag, becomes a text child of the script element. Nothing is displayed and no script is run. If <script src=\"javascriptfile.js\"/> is replaced by <script src=\"javascriptfile.js\"></script>, and ditto for <script src=\"javascriptfile2.js\"/>, the head start and end tags are silent discarded, and the script elements are not moved. \"Tile One Content Title Two Content\" is displayed and the scripts are run. The DTD makes no difference at all. IE is somewhat trickier to know, as before IE10, it doesn't use the HTML5 parser algorithm and therefore it's exact behaviour is a mystery. However, a cursory experiment appears to show that it has the same behaviour as described above. Although some legacy browsers move elements that can only appear in the head - such as <link> - into the head, other browsers do not, and no such behaviour can be relied upon. All in all, best steer well clear of such constructs. I don't know about practices for Apache Tiles.\n",

      "Unfortunately not — the {: toc} syntax doesn't accept any modifications other than through toc_levels (which allows your to specify the toc depth; see the options documentation (https://kramdown.gettalong.org/options.html) for details). Essentially you can specify whether you'd like the list to be unordered or ordered (https://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#toc) depending on whether you use * Table of contents {: toc} or 1. Table of contents {: toc} You can also exclude headers by using the {: .no_toc} option (at least if you're using auto-ids, since as only headers with ids are added, if you are not using that option you can also just not provide an id): # Header {: .no_toc} Anything else you have to do with CSS, Javascript, or postprocessing. However, that's often relatively straightforward as you can wrap the entire toc in a <div> if you wish or add whatever class you want to the <ul>/<ol> enclosing the toc. If you're having trouble getting the toc to generate within your div, make sure you're allowing for block level parsing (https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#html-blocks) either with parse_block_html globally or markdown=\"block\" options on the table of contents itself. For example, # Header <div markdown=\"block\" id=\"xyzzy\"> * TOC {: toc .class} </div> should generate <h1 id=\"header\">Header</h1> <div id=\"xyzzy\"> <ul class=\"class\" id=\"markdown-toc\"> <li><a href=\"#header\" id=\"markdown-toc-header\">Header</a></li> </ul> </div>\n",

      "You can not just use DOM in your unit tests, because that is UNIT test, not end-2-end. There is no real DOM available in jasmine environment. Stuff like \"$(\"#selectpicker\").selectpicker();\" should be incapsulated inside directives, and you can test directives separately using other methods with virtual DOM ( https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-unit-testing-a-directive (https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-unit-testing-a-directive) ) In your services or factories you want to test any DOM operations are untestable, so refactor your service in proper way to extract any DOM work to directives\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, I figured out what was going wrong. I was under the assumption that you could run the tests just like any other Jasmine tests, meaning: with the SpecRunner.html file. This is, however, NOT true. You can only run AngularJS tests using Karma. While this may seem logical, I find it truly non logical, to be honest. The biggest point to make is that you even see that you are loading a JASMINE_ADAPTER (in your karma configuration file), which is basically overwriting parts of the Jasmine testing framework. To be quite honest, I find this a very bad solution, and expected differently from the AngularJS team. If you start overriding the internals of a framework the way they did, you are hacking your way towards a solution, which is not a road you want to go down in the long run. I have been writing JS tests for some time now, and found Jasmine to be very lightweight, and easy to implement. One of my previous projects, we used KnockoutJS. I implemented Jasmine at the time, to be able to do TDD for JS. It was easy, and worked perfectly. So for this assignment, I opted to use AngularJS as a technology, since I was quite taken with the way it works, after fiddling around a little bit with it. I admit, I did not try to write unit tests, because they were all Jasmine based, and it seemed like a no-brainer. Important lesson learned, at my part. Now, I need to install Node.JS, Karma and PhantomJS to be able to run these tests on our build server. In my book, AngularJS just lost a lot of points. I'm even in doubt if the investment for the whole testing setup is worth the choice of the framework. I do admit, AngularJS is superior to a lot of its competition on many levels - but nothing, and really nothing, is as important as being able to write fully tested software, preferably TDD style. Oh yes, Karma seems to be the bomb, with all the automatic checking of directories and all that - but think about it: you need to drag in all of its dependencies (which are not trivial) to be able to use it. Pure Jasmine works out of the box, headless in a Maven build, with a minimal amount of configuration. Hmpf. Not amused.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "The error message \"TypeError: clickedElement.parentElement.querySelector is not recognized as a valid function\" indicates that you're trying to use a method that's specific to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM), which isn't available in the Karma-Jasmine testing environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karma-Jasmine testing is designed to simulate the behavior of a browser without actually rendering a page. Therefore, you cannot directly manipulate the DOM as you would in a browser. Instead, you should focus on testing the behavior of your components, services, and controllers in isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this issue, consider the following approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Refactor your code**: Extract the DOM manipulation logic into directives or components, which can then be tested separately. This way, you can mock the necessary DOM elements and their interactions in your tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use Jasmine spies and stubs**: If possible, refactor your code to rely less on direct DOM manipulation and more on observable behaviors. Then, use Jasmine spies and stubs to mock the necessary functions and properties in your tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Test utility functions**: If the problematic code is part of a utility function, create a separate test suite for those functions outside of your main component or service tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider using end-to-end testing tools**: For testing the integration between different parts of your application, including DOM manipulations, consider using end-to-end testing tools like Protractor. These tools simulate user interactions and can handle DOM manipulations. However, keep in mind that end-to-end tests are generally slower and less focused than unit tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, to fix this issue, refactor your code to minimize direct DOM manipulation and focus on testing individual components, services, and controllers in isolation using Karma-Jasmine. Utilize Jasmine spies, stubs, and utility function tests where appropriate. Additionally, consider using end-to-end testing tools like Protractor for testing integrated DOM manipulations.\n",

      "Using Ajax to retrieve information from an HTML form: What are the steps?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a very basic example. We start out with a form on an HTML page. When this button is clicked, we are going to activate a javascript function. <html> <form> <input type=\"email\" id=\"email-field\" /> <input id=\"submitButton\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /> </form> </html> Now, here is the javascript function being activated due to the button click. Inside, we extract any information that might have been filled out in the input field with id of \"email-field\", then send that off via ajax to a php file that sits on the server. $('#submitButton').click(function() { var email = $('#email-field').val(); $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: './yourphpfilename.php', data: { email: email } }).done(function(data) { console.log(data) // Will send you the result that is echoed in the PHP file }) }) As long as you put the correct url in your ajax request to your PHP file, you can easily receive the data being sent like so, <?php if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') { $email = $_POST['email']; echo 'I have received your request.'; } To send the data back, I use the echo command to do so here. Try to read some documentation on the $_POST variable in PHP. Notice how I call for ['email']. The identifier inside the brackets directly correlates to the key inside the data object in the js file. For example, say we decided to name our email key something different in the js file. data: { useremail: email } You would then just change the PHP code like so, $email = $_POST['useremail']; This was very confusing for me starting out, and sometimes it's hard to even pose a quality question on it if you have no idea how it works. In the future though, I would atleast try to post some code showing that you attempted the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a basic example of using Ajax with form data. You can change it for any need, such as a login, settings, or registration form. I use something like this when I send any data to my server: I fetch the HTML elements with the data I need by using the data attributes (data-id, data-user, data-XYZ) and security token, and then send that data to the server side for verification. Once the data is verified, it is inserted into the database. Here is an article that covers validating data before the data is sent to the server (https://appcode.app/how-to-handle-form-data-with-jquery/). This example Ajax function can send the data to a remote address and return a response, errors, or other data. Another example can be found, which uses the jQuery $.ajax method to send data to a server (https://appcode.app/how-to-create-a-jquery-ajax-contact-form-in-php/) instead of the $.post method below: Sending Data: e.stopPropagation(); var id = $(this).data('id'); var token = document.getElementById(\"token\").value; $.post(\"https://{server-address}/process.php\",{ data: id, token: token }, Receive Data Response: function(data, status){ $(\"#load\").html(data); }); Full Code: $(document).on('click', '.report', function(e) { //on click, if ajax loaded in or not e.stopPropagation(); var id = $(this).data('id'); var token = document.getElementById(\"token\").value; $.post(\"https://{server-address}/process.php\",{ data: id, token: token }, function(data, status){ $(\"#load\").html(data); }); }); The token variable is to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery.

And, yes you don't need a <form> tag to do so. Check out this example. HTML: <label>Text</label> <textarea id=\"foo\"></textarea> <button id=\"submit\">Submit via Ajax</button> Javascript: $('#submit').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); // information to be sent to the server var info = $('#foo').val(); $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: 'server.php', data: {foo: info} }); }); Server-side Handler (PHP): server.php <?php // information received from the client $recievedInfo = $_POST['foo']; // do something with this information See this for your reference http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/)\n",

      "The steps to use Ajax to retrieve information from an HTML form are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First, include the jQuery library in your HTML file to facilitate Ajax requests. You can include it through a CDN (Content Delivery Network) in your HTML file's `<head>` section:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```html\n",
      "   <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "2. Create an HTML form where users will input their data:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```html\n",
      "   <form id=\"myForm\">\n",
      "     <label for=\"emailField\">Email:</label>\n",

      "     <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n",
      "   </form>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Write the JavaScript function to capture the form submission event and perform an Ajax request using jQuery's `$.ajax()` method:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   $('#myForm').on('submit', function(event) {\n",
      "     event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission\n",

      "       data: {\n",
      "         email: email // Data to be sent along with the request\n",

      "Please provide your best answer below:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In JavaScript, the number of characters in an object literal property name is theoretically unlimited due to the way the language is designed. However, practical limitations arise from the available memory on the system running the code, as well as performance considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scenario you've described involves creating an object with extremely long property names, which indeed pushes the boundaries of what's feasible without causing issues like memory exhaustion or significant performance degradation. Your observations demonstrate that, while there's no strict limit set by the JavaScript specification, the actual limit is influenced by the environment (e.g., the browser or Node.js runtime).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points to understand regarding long property names in JavaScript objects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Memory Consumption**: Each character in a property name contributes to the overall memory usage of the object. As the length increases, so does the memory footprint. Eventually, this can lead to OutOfMemory errors or cause the program to crash if the available memory is exceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Performance Impact**: Accessing and manipulating objects with very long property names can negatively affect performance. This is because each operation involving these properties requires more time for string comparisons and manipulations. At around 67 million characters, you began to notice these effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Browser and Environment Limitations**: Different browsers and environments may have varying capabilities and thresholds for handling such extremes. For instance, modern browsers might handle larger strings better than older ones due to improvements in their engines. Similarly, server-side environments like Node.js might behave differently compared to client-side JavaScript in a web browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Cases and Best Practices**: In real-world applications, using such extremely long property names is generally discouraged due to maintainability, readability, and performance concerns. Instead, consider using descriptive but concise variable names or, if necessary, encapsulate complex data structures within nested objects or arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **JSON Serialization**: If you're working with JSON serialization (which often underlies object literals), note that some parsers might have their own limits or optimizations that could affect the processing of objects with very long property names.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Alternative Approaches**:\n",
      "   - **Symbol Keys**: Use `Symbol` instances for property keys, as they offer a more stable and less memory-intensive approach compared to long strings.\n",

If Eager Execution is disabled, you can build a graph and then run it through tf.compat.v1.Session: a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) b = tf.add(a, 1) out = tf.multiply(a, b) out.eval(session=tf.compat.v1.Session()) # array([[ 2, 6], # [12, 20]], dtype=int32) See also TF 2.0 Symbols Map (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0) for a mapping of the old API to the new one.\n",

      "You are mixing numpy and tensorflow operations. Tensorflow accepts numpy arrays normally (their value is known statically, hence can be converted to a constant), but not vice versa (tensor value is known only when the session is run, except eager evaluation (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/eager/python/g3doc/guide.md)). The solution: change np.maximum to tf.maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was happening to me in eager as well. Looking at the docs here (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/convert_to_tensor) , I ended up trying tf.convert_to_tensor(input, dtype=tf.float32) And that worked for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The error actually stems from the fact that np.arange produces int32s by default but you specified a float32 return type. The error is gone with import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf with tf.Session() as sess: with tf.device(\"/gpu:0\"): def test_func(i): return i test_range = tf.constant(np.arange(5, dtype=np.float32)) test = sess.run(tf.map_fn(test_func, test_range, dtype=tf.float32)) print(test) I agree that the error message you got is rather confusing. You get the \"real\" error message by removing device placement: import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf with tf.Session() as sess: def test_func(i): return i test_range = tf.constant(np.arange(5)) test = sess.run(tf.map_fn(test_func, test_range, dtype=tf.float32)) print(test) # InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): TensorArray dtype is float but Op is trying to write dtype int32.\n",

      "Instead of an array containing integers you have created an array containing other arrays (note that final_array.dtype is not dtype('int64')). This is possible for numpy arrays, but not possible for tensorflow arrays (a tensorflow array can't contain other tensorflow arrays). This is why you get an error when you try to convert it. There is no way around this, tensorflow will not allow to have not matching dimension sizes. But since you want to use those arrays as an input to your network you can combine them into one array first and convert them afterwards: final_array = np.concatenate((in1_, in2_, in3_, in4_, in5_, in6_.reshape(-1))) const = tf.constant(final_array)\n",

      "It seems like you're encountering issues due to mixing NumPy and TensorFlow operations, and possibly dealing with incompatible data types. Here's a concise explanation and a solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In TensorFlow 2.x, Eager Execution is enabled by default, allowing you to call `.numpy()` directly on a Tensor object. However, ensure that you've correctly installed TensorFlow 2.x and that Eager Execution is indeed enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If you're still facing the `AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'numpy'` issue, make sure that you haven't disabled Eager Execution accidentally. You can enable it using `tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. When working with TensorFlow, avoid mixing NumPy and TensorFlow operations. If you need to perform NumPy-like operations, use TensorFlow's built-in functions instead. For instance, replace `np.maximum` with `tf.maximum`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Ensure that the data types of your tensors and NumPy arrays match. If you're converting a TensorFlow tensor to a NumPy array, their data types should be compatible. For example, if your tensor has a `float32` dtype, convert your NumPy array to `float32` as well using `train_data.astype(np.float32)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. If you're using TensorFlow v2, be aware that some functions and behaviors might differ from v1. Make sure you're importing TensorFlow correctly (`import tensorflow as tf`) and disabling eager execution if necessary using `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()`, especially if you're working with TensorFlow v1-style APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, ensure that Eager Execution is enabled, avoid mixing NumPy and TensorFlow operations, maintain consistent data types, and properly import TensorFlow when working with TensorFlow v2.\n",

It looks like you want a format string of \"M-dd-yyyy\" or possibly \"M-d-yyyy\". If you're trying to convert from one format to another, you need to first specify the format to parse, and then specify the format to format with: SimpleDateFormat parser = new SimpleDateFormat(\"M-dd-yyyy\"); SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(\"EEEE, MMMM/dd/yyyy\"); Date date = parser.parse(input); String output = formatter.format(date);\n",

      "\n",
      "Here is a step-by-step guide on how to correctly parse and format dates using `SimpleDateFormat`:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define the Input Format**: Use the correct format string for the date string you have. For example, if your date string is \"02-26-2013\", the appropriate format string would be `\"M-d-yyyy\"` (or `\"m-d-yyyy\"`).\n",

      "       Date date = parser.parse(input);\n",

      "   String output = formatter.format(date);\n",

      "\n",
      "A NullPointerException is thrown when you try and perform an action with a variable or object that has not yet been created. You can find some additional info here: What is a NullPointerException, and how do I fix it? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it) Specifically in your case you have created a new XSSFWorkbook() but you haven't loaded a file into it (the inputStream you declare is completely ignored), so it won't have any data/content to read from, and that is why you get the error. The easy solution is to change your existing line: XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(); And instead use one of the constructors (https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xssf/usermodel/XSSFWorkbook.html#constructor.detail) shown in the documentation that accepts the document that you want to load as an input. You are in luck and can pass the FileInputStream directly into the constructor as follows: XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(inputStream); I also recommend you do null checks any time you want to use the get methods for sheet, row, cell etc, because typically a blank cell for example will give a null result but it can be easily checked (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15764417/how-to-check-if-an-excel-cell-is-empty-using-apache-poi) for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't create an empty file and try to read it, that won't work. An empty zero byte file is not valid, and can't be loaded Instead, have POI create an new file for you, which you will write later. Change the code: if(xlFile.exists() && !xlFile.isDirectory()) xlFile.delete(); //delete if file already exists. xlFile.createNewFile(); inStream = new FileInputStream(xlFile); workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(inStream); To instead be: if(xlFile.exists() && !xlFile.isDirectory()) xlFile.delete(); //delete if file already exists. if (xlFile.toString().endsWith(\".xls\") { workbook = new HSSFWorkbook(); } else { workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(); } Also, if you do want to read an existing file, don't use a stream if you have a file!

      "According to the Apache POI Quick Guide (http://poi.apache.org/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html#FileInputStream), the POIFSFileSystem (or similarly, NPOIFSFileSystem) is only used with .xls (Excel versions through 2003) documents. The equivalent for .xlsx documents (Excel 2007+) is OPCPackage. OPCPackage pkg = OPCPackage.open(new File(\"file.xlsx\")); You can create an XSSFWorkbook from the OPCPackage: XSSFWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook(pkg); Or you can just create it directly: XSSFWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook(new File(\"file.xlsx\")); Generally it's better to create the workbook using a File instead of an InputStream, to save memory. Also, if you want code that doesn't care whether it's an .xls or an .xlsx: // or \"file.xlsx\" Workbook wb = WorkbookFactory.create(new File(\"MyExcel.xls\"));\n",

      "The method using the above code has a single parameter - FileInputStream. The first line in the code snippet is very much part of the code, but part of the invoking method. Since the method in question did not have knowledge of the Excel format or even a file extension to make an educated guess, I decided that I would first try to read the FileInputStream using HSSF API as below: Sheet sheet = null; try { POIFSFileSystem poifs = new POIFSFileSystem(inputFS); Workbook workbook = new HSSFWorkbook(poifs); sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); } catch (Exception e) { } if (sheet == null) { try { Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(inputFS); sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); } catch (Exception e) { } } The problem with the above code is that the state of the inputFS object during the second attempt of opening it via the XSSF API is unknown. And this yielded a read error. I replaced the above with the following code, which works fine and the issue appears to be resolved: Sheet sheet = null; try { Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(inputFS); sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); } catch (Exception e) { } I tested this with both XLS (older, binary) and XLSX (newer, XML-based) formats and it works.

Of course you could also use a traditional for statement to loop the Array. for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++) { var item = result[i]; alert(item.Key); } All of this assumes your response has the proper Content-Type setting, or you've give dataType:\"json\" to $.ajax().\n",

In plain language, this means you can now run pip install scipy on Windows and it will just work.

So, make a list of the main packages you want, check the specification to see the other dependencies you'll need to install to use those packages, go to the pre-built installer page, download them, and run the installers. Obviously you need to download the installers corresponding to your Python. You didn't say whether you're using 64-bit or 32-bit Python, and you need to know that.

      "I am unable to replicate this issue on Windows 7, wxPython 2.9.3.1, Python 2.6.6. However, when you see that issue where you can resize the frame and make everything pop into place, that usually means you need to put a Layout() call somewhere. Usually, you just need to call the frame or the top sizer's Layout() command right before your show it. It looks like you already have that though. The weird widget in panel_3 looks like something has the wrong parent, but since I don't see that issue when I run it, I can't diagnose it. Fortunately, there's a Widget Inspection Tool that you can use to figure out layout problems and lots of other things with. Here's a link: http://wiki.wxpython.org/Widget%20Inspection%20Tool (http://wiki.wxpython.org/Widget%20Inspection%20Tool) You should by able to use that to find out which widget that is and what its parent it too. Which will give you the information needed to fix it. UPDATE: Layout basically makes the widgets lay themselves out. It kind of forces a refresh. Fit will make them take up the smallest amount of space. I'm not sure why the frame's Layout isn't working in this case on your machine. As I mentioned, it works fine for me. Ask on the wxPython mailing list to get a full answer as that's where the wx developers are.\n",

      "1. Ensure that the proportion parameter in `Add` method of the sizer is set to 0 when adding collapsible panes. For example, change `sizer.Add(SampleCollapsiblePane(self.main_panel, label = str(x)), 1)` to `sizer.Add(SampleCollapsiblePane(self.main_panel, label = str(x)), 0)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bind the `wx.EVT_COLLAPSIBLEPANE_CHANGED` event to the collapsible pane instance to trigger a re-layout of the parent frame whenever a pane is collapsed or expanded. Add the following methods to your `SampleCollapsiblePane` class:\n",

      "   ```python\n",
      "   def __init__(...):\n",

      "3. If you encounter issues with the layout on specific platforms such as Windows, consider using alternative approaches. One possible workaround is to replace `self.main_sizer.Fit(self)` with `self.main_panel.Layout()` followed by `self.main_panel.Fit()`.\n",

      "If you want to register your own subscriptions to be notified of changes to observables, you can call their subscribe function, for example: myViewModel.personName.subscribe(function(newValue) { alert(\"The person's new name is \" + newValue); }); More details @ knockoutjs.com (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html#explicitly_subscribing_to_observables) Summarizing the comments below To get notified on every change in the ViewModel, check Ryan Niemeyer (http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/05/creating-smart-dirty-flag-in-knockoutjs.html) article and John papa (https://stackoverflow.com/users/13375/john-papa)'s changeTracker on NuGet\n",
      "\n",
      "If you just want to subscribe to a value changed, you can subscribe to any observable: var viewModel = { property: ko.observable() }; viewModel.property.subscribe(function(newValue) { //do stuff }); To subscribe to all properties of an object you could do something like: function subscribeAll(viewModel) { for(var propertyName in viewModel) { if(viewModel[propertyName].subscribe === 'function') { viewModel[propertyName].subscribe(function(newValue) { //do stuff } } } }\n",
      "\n",
      "You can call the subscribe function on a observable, giving it the callback function to be called when the observable changes. <input data-bind=\"value: val\"/> var Model = function() { var self = this; this.val = ko.observable(); this.val.subscribe(function () { alert(self.val()); }); }; ko.applyBindings(new Model());\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming you want the subscriber to fire each time the event is updated including the first time it gets set. You could try this; function EventsKoModel(data){ var self = this; self.event = ko.observable(); self.event.subscribe(function(){ console.log(\"something changed\"); }); ko.mapping.fromJS(data, {}, self); }\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want an observable to always notify a \"change\" even if it's not changed, you can do so with the notify extender (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html#forcing_observables_to_always_notify_subscribers): myObservable.extend({notify:'always'});\n",
      "\n",
      "\"is there any way to get knockout to somehow become callback aware?\" Yes, you can use subscriptions. All observables, observableArrays, and computeds inherit from the type subscribable so you can do this: var foo = ko.observable(\"foo\"); foo.subscribe(function (newValue) { // When foo updates, this function is called }); With subscriptions you can even set up temporary subscriptions and cancel them later if you no longer need them. var fooSub = foo.subscribe(function (newValue) { // When foo updates, this function is called }); // Somewhere else in the app... fooSub.dispose(); By default, subscriptions subscribe to a topic called 'change'. This means when the value of an observable changes, it calls any subscribers with the newValue (thus the name of the parameter), but you can also set up a subscription that subscribes to the topic 'beforeChange' in order to perform logic before some value changes. foo.subscribe(function (oldValue) { // Do logic on the oldValue here }, null, 'beforeChange'); And you can read about this in knockout's documentation (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html). But you can also subscribe to custom topics if you want. By default, when values of observables change, the 'beforeChange' and 'change' topics fire off before and after the value changes (respectively). But you can subscribe to a custom topic that you can later manually trigger, to notify any subscribers listening in on that topic. foo.subscribe(function (value) { // Do logic when observable notifies subscribers to the 'customTopic' topic }, null, 'customTopic'); // Somewhere else in the app... var value = \"bar\"; foo(value); foo.notifySubscribers(value, 'customTopic'); In this way you can set up communication between separate view models that have no direct references to each other. This is my cursory understanding of how to do this, you can learn more about it by watching Ryan Niemeyer's tips and tricks video (http://www.knockmeout.net/2013/09/devlink-2013-ko-tips.html). Specifically the subscriptions section. In this way you can perform a kind of callback in knockout. Also check out Ryan's Knockout-postbox (https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-postbox/) library that extends observables to subscribeTo and publishOn these topics. You can also look into jQuery $.Deferreds (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/) which is the underlying piece that $.ajax requests use. It's not a knockout callback but it is a kind of callback. Let me know if that is more of what you're looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I get your point, your aim is to add a custom function for the observables. In that case you should use fn instead of prototype. Check out this link: http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/fn.html (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/fn.html) I am not sure if this is possible to get the current value of observable inside the \"extension\" method And you can get the current value of your observable using this method, thus your above example is very close to what you want. ko.observable.fn.initialize = function(initializeFunc) { const currentValue = this; if (currentValue()) { initializeFunc(currentValue()); } else { const subscription = currentValue.subscribe(function(lookup) { initializeFunc(lookup); subscription.dispose(); }); } return this; } var ViewModel = function() { this.data = ko.observable().initialize(x => console.log(\"Value changed to: \" + x)); this.data(\"100\"); }; ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel()); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-min.js\"></script> ================================ NOTE: There is a discussion on why fn is used instead of prototype and someone pointed in there that it is better to use extenders (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/extenders.html) for some performance reasons. Read it here: https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/979 (https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/979)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry all, just found that i can provide subscriptions with the context. The full syntax for subscribe is something like observableItem.subscribe(function (newValue) {...}, context, stringVal) where stringVal can be \"beforeChange\" that will subscribe you to the event before change. I didnt know that as they don't document it (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html#explicitly_subscribing_to_observables) at the official site. Btw anybody knows where the latest docs are?\n",
      "\n",
      "Any knockout obervable's subscribe() should be called only when there is a change in the value. This isn't entirely true, according to the knockout maintainers. Knockout uses an equalityComparer to determine whether a new value differs from the old one: console.log( ko.observable.fn.equalityComparer ) <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-debug.js\"></script> As you can see, it only actually does a === if the values are primitive. Any other values, like objects, arrays and functions, just always trigger a change. I usually \"fix\" this by overwriting the default: const someObj = {}; const someObs = ko.observable(someObj); someObs.subscribe(console.log); // Logs {} console.log(\"with regular eq comparer\"); someObs(someObj); // Change equalityComparer for *every* observable: ko.observable.fn.equalityComparer = (a, b) => a === b; // No longer logs: console.log(\"with custom eq comparer\"); someObs(someObj); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-min.js\"></script> If you don't want to overwrite all equalityComparers, you can also change it on just one observable instance. The reasoning for the default behavior, is that many people expect this to trigger updates: (which it doesn't when you use my custom comparer) const someObj = { a: 1 }; const someObs = ko.observable(someObj); someObj.a = 2; someObs(someObj)\n",
      "\n",
      "The observer/observable design pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) does allow for multiple observers/subscriptions. The purpose of the design pattern in short is: De-couple the change from the effects of the change. Allow for any and arbitrary effects to stem from a change. So, Knockout does that through its observables. var observable = ko.observable(\"a\"); observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { console.log(\"observer 1\", newValue) }); observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { console.log(\"observer 2\", newValue) }); observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { console.log(\"observer 3\", newValue) }); observable(\"b\"); observable(\"c\"); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-min.js\"></script> There is no race condition to really worry about because your code will be run in a single thread (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21718774/how-is-javascript-single-threaded), so it's pretty much guaranteed to be deterministic, unless you explicitly opt-into some sort of multi-threadedness (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30036/javascript-and-threads). An observer will usually also not inherently invoke multiple threads anyway, as the subsribers update functionality is generally going to take the form of something like: for (subscriber of this.subscribers) { subscriber.update(this.value); } With this said, you might run into problems but only if subscribers depend on a shared state and you cannot guarantee or know the order each subscription is added. In that case, you can get different results based on the order of the subscriptions. Simple demonstration: var observable = ko.observable(\"a\"); var sharedState = \"\"; observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { //append to the shared state sharedState += newValue; console.log(\"observer 1\", sharedState); }); observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { //double up the shared state sharedState += sharedState; console.log(\"observer 2\", sharedState); }); observable(\"b\"); observable(\"c\"); observable(\"d\"); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-min.js\"></script> var observable = ko.observable(\"a\"); var sharedState = \"\"; observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { //double up the shared state sharedState += sharedState; console.log(\"observer 2\", sharedState); }); observable.subscribe(function(newValue) { //append to the shared state sharedState += newValue; console.log(\"observer 1\", sharedState); }); observable(\"b\"); observable(\"c\"); observable(\"d\"); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.2/knockout-min.js\"></script> So, this would be a bad practice. It would be best avoided if possible. Unless you can guarantee the order of subscriptions - in the example above, I add the subscriptions one after another which guarantees that they show up in the order they are added. But you might have code that adds subscriptions conditionally or in different parts of the application, in which case it's hard to keep that order under control.\n",

Meteor.user() is reactive, it would ensure that the Deps.autorun callback runs again when it changes, so you could theoretically use it to do things when the user logs in or out. Other alternatives is there is a package on atmosphere that provides login and logout hooks, though they basically would use the Deps.autorun like above to work anyway.

The rendered-callback is just fired once Blaze (https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Using-Blaze#rendered-callback-only-fires-once).

      "To refresh a Meteor template upon user authentication, you can use the `Meteor.user()` helper, which is reactive and will trigger a re-render of the template whenever the user's authentication status changes. Here's a simple example:\n",

      "  {{/if}}\n",
      "</template>\n",
      "```\n",

      "Understanding how Python imports work is tricky in the beginning but makes sense once you understand how. There are different way to fix your import issue. I would not recommend messing up with sys.path. Depending on where you are calling your script, you have multiple choice at hand. Your Directory structure. ├── common │ ├── common.py │ └── __init__.py ├── project1 │ ├── __init__.py │ └── scripts │ ├── example_import.py │ └── __init__.py └── project2 ├── __init__.py └── scripts └── __init__.py On the root of directory python project1/scripts/example_import.py Will work, assuming that the imports in example_import.py looks like from common.common import Test If you want to use from common import Test, you need to add from common.common import Test in __init__.py file in common folder. You can also use PYTHONPATH environment variable to tell Python where to look for the base module. PYTHONPATH=/pathto/basefolder python folder/filesx.py Another way is to create a setup.py on base and do development installation python -m pip install --editable . on environment you are working on. Example of setup.py #!/usr/bin/env python from distutils.core import setup setup(name='projectX', version='1.0', description='The World is not Enoug', author='James Bond', author_email='agent@007.net', url='https://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/', packages=['common', 'project1', 'project2], ) See Python Documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html) for more setup.py options.\n",

Take a look at this article, it describes python's import statement in details: https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html (https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html)\n",

Since '/home/dabljues/projects/project/project' is not included, there is no way for python to resolve it during runtime. A quick hack You can just add the path manually to sys.path, either in the source file by running import sys; sys.insert(0, '/home/dabljues/projects/project/project/') in foo.py before any other imports happen, or by running export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/home/dabljues/projects/project/project/\" in your shell before run.sh. Installing the project Since it looks like you're developing a library, you might as well use the mechanisms python offers to make libraries shareable and thereby fixing any import issues. Add a minimal setup.py to the project root (i.e. /home/dabljues/projects/project/project/setup.py): from setuptools import setup, find_packages setup( name='project', version='0.1.0', packages=find_packages('project'), ) And install your project in editable mode: $ python3 -m pip install -e .

      "The issue you're facing is related to Python's import mechanism and how it resolves module paths. When you're not within a virtual environment, Python doesn't know where to look for your custom modules unless you explicitly tell it. Here are several ways to solve this problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using PYTHONPATH**: Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the directory containing your custom modules. For example, in Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS), you can set it as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/project\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "   Or, in Windows:\n",

      "   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/project` or `C:\\path\\to\\your\\project` with the actual path to your project directory. Now, Python will search for modules in this directory alongside its default locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Modifying sys.path programmatically**: You can modify the `sys.path` list directly in your Python script to include the directory containing your custom modules. This approach is less recommended than setting the PYTHONPATH since it affects the entire script execution. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import sys\n",
      "   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/your/project')\n",

      "\n",
      "   Again, replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Creating a package and using `setup.py`**: Organize your project into a package by placing a `__init__.py` file in each directory you wish to treat as a package. Then, create a `setup.py` file in the root of your project with the following content:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",

      "   Now, you can import your modules as `from YourProjectName import module`.\n",

Selectable Rows (https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/row-selection/) So, when you click a row, I'm marking it as selected. There is a property on ag-grid rowSelection: 'single' | 'multiple.

For your problem, I have added a filter that says if any row is selected, remove it from the grid. Following are the changes /// method called on clicking the button function hideRow(params) { let rowNode = gridOptions.api.getRowNode(params.value); // get the clicked row rowNode.setSelected(true); //mark as selected gridOptions.api.onFilterChanged(); // trigger filter change } Triggering the filter change will call this method for each row function doesExternalFilterPass(node) { return !node.selected; // if row node is selected dont show it on grid. } You can access the rows hidden any time using gridOptions.api.getSelectedRows() //Returns an array of data from the selected rows. OR gridOptions.api.getSelectedNodes() //Returns an array of the selected nodes. And, if you want to show a row again, just filter from this above mentioned method and do these steps rowNode.setSelected(false); //mark as unselected gridOptions.api.onFilterChanged(); // trigger filter change This will automatically show the row on grid.

Once you close/hide the modal you set this.state.show to false and the modal will not be shown. var PostTitle = React.createClass({ getInitialState() { return {show: false}; }, openPost : function() { var postData = this.props.postData; console.log(\"clicked - openPost\"); this.setState({show: true}); }, closePost: function () { this.setState({show: false}); }, render : function() { var postData = this.props.postData; return( <div className=\"item\" onClick={this.openPost}> <MyModal show={this.state.show} onHide={this.closePost} /> <div className=\"well\"> <img src={postData.image}/> <p>{postData.title}</p> </div> </div> ) } });\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "To conceal AG-Grid when activating a button to display a modal dialog, you can implement the following approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use the `postProcessPopup` callback provided by Ag-Grid to track the column menu popup element.\n",
      "2. Store the columnMenu element in a variable called `columnMenu`.\n",
      "3. Implement a listener to detect when the column menu is no longer visible in the DOM.\n",
      "4. If the column menu is no longer visible and the `columnMenu` variable is not null, set `columnMenu` to null.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a sample code snippet demonstrating this approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "```typescript\n",
      "import { ColumnApi, GridOptions } from '@ag-grid-community/core';\n",
      "\n",
      "export class CustomGrid implements GridOptions {\n",
      "  private columnMenu: any = null;\n",
      "\n",
      "  postProcessPopup = (params: { ePopup: HTMLElement }) => {\n",
      "    this.columnMenu = params.ePopup;\n",
      "  };\n",
      "\n",
      "  constructor(private gridOptions: GridOptions, private columnApi: ColumnApi) {}\n",
      "\n",
      "  hideGridOnClick() {\n",
      "    const columnMenuIsInDom = document.body.contains(this.columnMenu);\n",
      "\n",
      "    if (!columnMenuIsInDom && this.columnMenu!== null) {\n",
      "      this.columnMenu = null;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you can use the `rowSelection` feature of Ag-Grid to select and hide specific rows when a button is clicked. By utilizing the `onFilterChanged` method, you can trigger a filter change and remove the selected rows from the grid. This approach allows you to maintain the selected row state while effectively hiding the corresponding grid rows.\n",

      "Elaborate on the role of consistency in horizontally scalable web applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start it from the beginning. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there were SQL databases with ACID transactions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). What we are really interested here are the atomicity and consistency from the ACID ancronym. For example if you have two changes a1 -> a2 and b1 -> b2 and you make them in such a transaction then the changes must be atomic and you will have only 2 valid state options: a1, b1 and a2, b2. So if the a1 -> a2 change fails, then the whole transaction fails. This is called immediate consistency. In contrast there are noSQL databases, which are not ACID compliant. By these databases your changes are not atomic and you can have multiple states: a1, b1, a2, b1, a1, b2, a2, b2, depending on what order the changes are made or which changes fail. This is called eventual consistency. If you have a distributed system with complex changes which involve multiple computers, then you have two options. You can use eventual consistency, which will be very fast, but the data won't be consistent on multiple machines. Or you can use immediate consistency with 2 phase commit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol), and the updates will be very slow, but the data will be consistent between the machines. By DDD the aggregate is a consistency boundary: the inside changes with immediate consistency and the outside changes with eventual consistency. To stick with the same example, you want to change 2 things with your command: a1 -> a2 and b1 -> b2. If these things are in the same aggregate x, then you can change them in the same transaction: (x.a1, x.b1) -> (x.a2, x.b2) using immediate consistency. If these things are in different aggregates: x, y, then you cannot change them in the same transaction, so you have to use eventual consistency: x.a1 -> x.a2 and y.b1 -> y.b2 will be the two transactions which will be committed independently from each other. By DDD there is a rule according to Vernon's book; you cannot change multiple aggregates in a single transaction. If you do so, then it is a code smell, which is a sign to choose the consistency boundaries differently, or in other terms design the aggregates differently. So by designing aggregates you have to keep in mind these consistency boundaries. If you don't do so, then it will cause concurrency issues. For example you have a and b properties on your aggregate x. These properties are independent from each other, so either (x.a1, x.b2) and (x.a2, x.b1) are valid states. If John wants to change x.a1 -> x.a2 and Jane wants to change x.b1 -> x.b2 in two concurrent requests, then one of the requests will fail despite the fact, that both scenarios: (x.a1, x.b1) -> (x.a2, x.b1) -> (x.a2, x.b2) and (x.a1, x.b1) -> (x.a1, x.b2) -> (x.a2, x.b2) would result the same state (x.a2, x.b2) and each of the steps are valid. So either John or Jane will have a bad day by working on the same aggregate simultaneously. Probably both of them if they send multiple concurrent requests. You can resolve this problem by creating a new aggregate y and moving the b property into that. So the changes will be x.a1 -> x.a2 and y.b1 -> y.b2 in two transactions, which won't cause trouble. The inverse example if you have two aggregates x and y and the properties x.a and y.b cannot change independently. So the x.a1, y.b2 and x.a2, y.b1 states are invalid. This is a sign to merge these two aggregates into one and use immediate consistency instead of eventual consistency. There is a good chance that your system will run on multiple machines. The bigger components, like bounded contexts, aggregates will be eventually consistent, while the small ones, like value objects, entities will be immediately consistent. Thus you can deploy your bounded contexts on multiple machines without distributed transactions and 2 phase commit, which will result a fast and reliable system. On the other hand the aggregates can have only valid states thanks to the transactions you use by them. Note that I am not an expert of the topic, I just read a book. =] 1y later: I found a very good article about aggregates (http://geekswithblogs.net/Optikal/archive/2013/04/07/152643.aspx). According to it you should put consistency boundaries around invariants to prevent contract violation. So if you have a list of invariants, then you can use them to define consistency boundaries. Aggregate boundaries will be similar. Ideally they include every invariant, but if they grow too big, they will result too many concurrency exceptions, so in complex cases they can't include some of the invariants.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency plays a crucial role in horizontally scalable web applications, particularly when dealing with distributed systems. It ensures that all nodes in the system agree on the state of shared data, preventing conflicts and maintaining data integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of ACID transactions, immediate consistency guarantees that all operations within a transaction are atomic and consistent, resulting in two valid states: the initial state and the final state. This approach ensures strong consistency but can lead to performance bottlenecks due to the need for synchronous communication among nodes during transaction processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, eventual consistency allows for higher performance as it enables asynchronous replication of data across nodes. However, it introduces the possibility of temporary inconsistencies between nodes, where different nodes may have different versions of the same data at any given time. Eventual consistency relies on conflict resolution mechanisms to ensure that the system converges towards a consistent state over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When designing horizontally scalable web applications, it is essential to consider the trade-offs between consistency and performance. In some cases, immediate consistency might be required for critical operations, while eventual consistency can suffice for less time-sensitive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides guidelines for defining consistency boundaries through the concept of aggregates. Aggregates act as consistency boundaries, ensuring immediate consistency within their boundaries while allowing eventual consistency between aggregates. This separation helps maintain data integrity while enabling horizontal scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid concurrency issues, it is important to carefully design aggregates based on the independence of their properties. Properties that can change independently should belong to separate aggregates, while those that cannot should be part of the same aggregate. This approach minimizes the risk of conflicting updates and ensures that only valid states are possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, consistency in horizontally scalable web applications involves balancing immediate consistency for critical operations and eventual consistency for non-critical ones. Aggregates serve as consistency boundaries, enforcing immediate consistency within their boundaries and enabling horizontal scaling without distributed transactions. Properly designed aggregates help prevent concurrency issues and ensure data integrity.\n",

Note that ctypes does not inspect the DLL and automatically load all the functions. You have to declare the functions, parameters and return values yourself. See ctypes:structures and unions (https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#structures-and-unions) for the Structure syntax. Also note that for a DLL with _stdcall functions use WinDLL instead of CDLL. x.py #!python3 import ctypes class FileParams(ctypes.Structure): _fields_ = [('val1',ctypes.c_float), ('pMarker',ctypes.c_void_p)] x = ctypes.WinDLL('x') x.Function1.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p,ctypes.c_char_p,ctypes.POINTER(FileParams)] x.Function1.restype = ctypes.c_int fp = FileParams(1.234,None) x.Function1(b'abc',b'def',ctypes.byref(fp)) And the output: abc def 1.234000 0000000000000000\n",

      "\n",
      "The `ctypes` library in Python does not have a predefined default directory for loading shared libraries (`CDLL`). Instead, it relies on the system's dynamic linker to locate and load the required libraries based on their names and paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "To specify the location of a shared library when using `CDLL`, you should provide the full path to the library file. If the library is located in a standard system directory, such as `/usr/lib` on Linux or `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32` on Windows, you don't need to provide the full path. However, if the library is located elsewhere, you should provide the full path to ensure it gets loaded correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of loading a shared library using `CDLL`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import ctypes\n",
      "\n",
      "# For Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS, etc.)\n",
      "libc = ctypes.CDLL('/usr/lib/libc.so.6')\n",
      "\n",
      "# For Windows\n",
      "libc = ctypes.windll.kernel32\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to search for a library in standard system directories without specifying the full path, you can use the `ctypes.util.find_library()` function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import ctypes.util\n",
      "\n",
      "libc_path = ctypes.util.find_library('c')\n",
      "libc = ctypes.CDLL(libc_path)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This will search for the 'c' library in standard system directories and return its path, which can then be used with `CDLL`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, `ctypes` does not have a default directory for loading shared libraries. You should always provide the full path or let the system's dynamic linker handle the library search process using `find_library()`.\n",

What happens with a drop shadow effect is that the drop shadow is visible through the translucent area. Normally, when you have an opaque foreground, you can see the shadow through the foreground, but when you have a translucent foreground, the shadow mars the translucent effect a bit. To understand what I mean, review the above images and note the difference between the translucent area in the images with and without a drop shadow involved. So you might want to rethink the design to not use the drop shadow. There are ways around this using clips (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25534204/how-do-i-create-a-javafx-transparent-stage-with-shadows-on-only-the-border), but it gets a bit more complicated and you cannot achieve it using just CSS (you will also need to write some custom skin code in Java, which I won't demonstrate here).\n",

Or combine both, if you prefer.

      "Python is not pass-by-reference. It is pass-by-object. Consider the following two functions: def f(mylist): mylist = [] def g(mylist): mylist.append(1) Now let's say I call them. mylist = [1] f(mylist) print(mylist) mylist = [1] # reset the list g(mylist) print(mylist) What would the output be? If Python were pass-by-value, the functions would take a copy of the list, so modifying it would not affect the original list once you return out of the function. So in both cases, you would be printing the original list, [1]. If Python were pass-by-reference, the functions would accept a reference to the object and modifying it would modify the actual object that the reference references, so the first output would be [] and the second, [1,2]. If you run this example, you will find that the first output is [1] (the list if unaffected) and second output is [1,2] (the list is affected). O_O When you do new_temp_obj = obj[:], Python is constructing a new object obj[:] and giving it the name new_temp_obj. If you were to append, Python would look for the thing called new_temp_obj and add elements to it. The argument you passed in tells it where to look for the list.

      "In Python, variables are references to objects. This means that when you pass a variable as an argument to a function, you're not passing the value of the variable itself, but rather a reference to the object it points to. However, Python does not pass by reference in the strictest sense because mutable objects like lists can behave differently than immutable objects like integers or strings.\n",

      "So when you're defining methods that are a part of a class, they all have 'self' as the first parameter. You also don't include parenthesis when you define the class unless it's inheriting from another class However, there are a couple more errors. I think it's probably a formatting error, but the last couple of lines need to be unindented so they're outside of the class. If they're supposed to be a part of the class, then you're gonna want to put them in their own methods (also including the self parameter). In order to make the calls to a lottery class work without an instance, they have to be static as well. So getting it to run would involve making your code look like this... import random drawn=[] class Lottery: #no parenthesis def __init__(self, letter, drawn): self.letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h'] self.letter = letter self.drawn = drawn @staticmethod def drawnumbers(self): #include self number = random.randint(0, 10) return number @staticmethod def drawletters(self): #include self letter = random.choice(self.letters) return letter #no parenthesis #unindent so we aren't in the class anymore for i in range(0,9): drawn.append(Lottery.drawnumbers()) for i in range(0,3): drawn.append(Lottery.drawletters()) print(drawn) #at this point, drawn is not associated with the lottery class # to associate it, you need to make a variable out of the class lotteryObj = Lottery(\"A\", drawn) #it takes 2 arguments, letter and drawn print(lotteryObj.drawn) #=> [...] print(lotteryObj.letter) #=> \"A\" However, this isn't really how classes should work. If you want to make a lottery class, it would be a good idea to have that class hold the data it uses, and have methods that effect that data. This is where default parameters come in handy. They let you define parameters for your class that don't need to be given. This way, you can have a list of some drawn lottery numbers, give it to your lottery class, and then have it add to the list with more numbers/letters drawn. import random drawn=[] class Lottery: #no parenthesis def __init__(self, drawn=[]): #default for drawn, letter not needed self.letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h'] self.drawn = drawn #if you don't give the class a list, it makes an empty list def drawnumbers(self): #include self number = random.randint(0, 10) #instead of returning, change the list this class has using self self.drawn.append(number) def drawletters(self): #include self letter = random.choice(self.letters) self.drawn.append(letter) #you can add a print method or get methods for printing or getting the drawn list #unindent so we aren't in the class anymore lotto1 = Lottery() lotto2 = Lottery([1]) #give it a list with something in it for i in range(0,9): lotto1.drawnumbers() lotto2.drawnumbers() for i in range(0,3): lotto1.drawletters() lotto2.drawletters() print(lotto1.drawn) print(lotto2.drawn)\n",

      "It sounds like what you want is for make_lottery_set_type to return a new class, presumably one that's a subclass of LotteryGameType, rather than returning an instance of that type. This is actually pretty easy to do in Python. Class definitions are just normal code, that you can run anywhere, even in the middle of a function. And they have access to the local environment while they're running. And classes themselves are \"first-class values\", meaning you can pass them around and return them from functions. So: def make_lottery_set_type(name:str, size:int, minmax:tuple): if minmax[0] > minmax[1]: raise LotterySetError('Illegal range for tuple') else: class NewLotteryGameType(LotteryGameType): def __init__(self, numbers): super().__init__(name, size, minmax[0], minmax[1]) self.numbers = numbers return NewLotteryGameType If you want to add other methods, that's the same as adding methods to any other class. For example: def make_lottery_set_type(name:str, size:int, minmax:tuple): if minmax[0] > minmax[1]: raise LotterySetError('Illegal range for tuple') else: class NewLotteryGameType(LotteryGameType): def __init__(self, numbers): super().__init__(name, size, minmax[0], minmax[1]) self.numbers = numbers def __eq__(self, rhs): return set(self.numbers) == set(rhs.numbers) return NewLotteryGameType So: >>> SuperLotto = make_lottery_set_type('SuperLotto', 6, (1,50)) >>> super1 = SuperLotto([1,2,3,4,5,6]) >>> super2 = SuperLotto([6,5,4,3,2,1]) >>> super3 = SuperLotto([7,8,9,10,11,12]) >>> super1 == super2 True >>> super1 == super3 False (Obviously you can define __eq__ however you want, if set-equality isn't the right rule for your use.) If you try to inspect the values you're generating, they don't look quite as pretty as you might like. For example, you'd probably rather see SuperLotto rather than NewLotteryGameType in places like this: >>> super1 <__main__.NewLotteryGameType at 0x10259e490> >>> SuperLotto.__name__ 'NewLotteryGameType' For that, just add NewLotteryGameType.__name__ = name. You might also want to copy over the docstring from the parent class, or various other things. More generally, look at functools.update_wrapper (which is designed for wrapping up functions, not classes, but many of the details are the same) for inspiration, and the inspect module docs from your Python version for all of the attributes that classes can have. In a comment, you ask: The only problem is that I want NewLotteryGameType to inherit the parameters such as name, set_size, min_set_number, max_set_number from LotteryGameType. So lets say I wanted to type in NewLotteryGameType.set_size in to the Python Shell. I want it to return back to me 6. That's contradictory. If you want to inherit the instance attributes of LotteryGameType… well, you already do. For example: >>> super1.set_size 6 If you want them to be accessible off the class, then they can't be instance attributes, they have to be class attributes. And just changing set_size to a class attribute of LotteryGameType and inheriting it won't work, because the whole point of a class attribute is that the same value shared by all instances of the class or any of its subclasses, and the subclasses all need different values. But you could do something like this: class LotteryGameType: def __init__(self, min_set_number, max_set_number): self.min_set_number = min_set_number self.max_set_number = max_set_number def make_lottery_set_type(lottery_name:str, size:int, minmax:tuple): if minmax[0] > minmax[1]: raise LotterySetError('Illegal range for tuple') else: class NewLotteryGameType(LotteryGameType): name = lottery_name set_size = size def __init__(self, numbers): super().__init__(minmax[0], minmax[1]) self.numbers = numbers def __eq__(self, rhs): return set(self.numbers) == set(rhs.numbers) return NewLotteryGameType (Notice that I had to rename the first make_ parameter to lottery_name so it was different from the class attribute name, because of the way scopes work.) Now, name and set_size are not instance attributes, nor are they class attributes of LotteryGameType—but they're class attributes of each NewLotteryGameType. So: >>> SuperLotto = make_lottery_set_type('SuperLotto', 6, (1,50)) >>> SuperDuperLotto = make_lottery_set_type('SuperDuperLotto', 8, (1,100)) >>> SuperLotto.set_size 6 >>> SuperDuperLotto.set_size 8 What if you create instances of those types? Well, Python looks for attributes in the instance, then in the most-derived class, and then the base classes. So as long as you don't create instance attributes with the same name (notice that I removed the extra params, and the code that set instance attributes, from the LotteryGameType.__init__ method), it does just what you'd want: >>> super1 = SuperLotto([1,2,3,4,5,6]) >>> super1.set_size 6 >>> duper1 = SuperDuperLotto([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) >>> duper1.set_size 8 Of course this means that LotteryGameType is no longer a usable type on its own; only its subclasses are usable. But that's probably what you wanted anyway, right? You could even consider making it explicitly an abstract base class (http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/abc.html) to make sure nobody accidentally tries to use a direct LotteryGameType instance. If you're feeling brave, you might want to read up on metaclasses and see how you could adapt this whole design into use a LotteryGameMetaclass, so each new class is an instance of that metaclass instead of a subclass of the (abstract) base class. The source for the new enum (http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/enum.py) module in 3.4, or the near-equivalent external flufl.enum (https://code.launchpad.net/flufl.enum) package, might make good sample code. Then you can play with both and see how similar and how different they are.\n",

For example initialize: function () { this.tmpl1 = _.template(\"<p>hello: <%= name %></p>\"); //HTML hardcoded this.tmpl2 = _.template( $.trim( $('#tmpl').html() ) ); } However this has the disadvantage of the template being compiled for every instance of your view, what would probably make more sense in your case is to store your template separately and require it and use that.\n",

There are two ways of using require: 1) Synchronous: var baz = require('foo/bar') 2) Asynchronous: require(['foo/bar'], function(bar) {var baz = bar;} The problem is, you're combining the two with this line: this.template = _.template( require( ['text!templates/users/view.html'] ) You're giving the dependencies to require as an array, as if you were doing the async-style, but you're expecting it to immediately return the module, sync-style. The solution is simple, either: A) Pre-load (either with a define call or an async require call) your templates, then use the sync-style syntax: this.template = _.template( require('text!templates/users/view.html') // NOTE: If you don't pre-load this won't work or: B) Use the async-style: require(['text!templates/users/view.html'], function(viewTemplate) { View = Backbone.View.extend({ // rest of your code this.template = _.template(viewTemplate); })\n",

The this.view_templates assignment in your constructor (initialize) is needed because you presumably want each instance of the view to have its own copy of the array. Creating a new view instance doesn't do a deep copy of the the view so if you just have: MessageView = Backbone.View.extend({ view_templates: {}, // ... then all the instances will end up sharing the same view_templates object and view_templates will behave more like a class variable than an instance variable. You can specify your instance variables in the view definition (i.e. the Backbone.View.extend() call) as a form of documentation but you will want to initialize any of them that should behave as an instance variable in your initialize method; read-only or \"class variables\" like events can be left as part of the view's definition.\n",

If you would put a debugger and examine the value of this inside the render which gets executed by the model change, it would not be holding the reference of view. You can get this fixed by passing a third parameter to the on as specified in backbone documentation (http://backbonejs.org/#Events-on): this.model.on( 'all', this.render, this ); The third parameter is the context in which the render would be executed. Meaning, whatever you pass as the third parameter, would be the value of this inside the render function. It's better to use listenTo instead of on as it cleans up the events in a better way than on does. You can read nice explanation for the same thing here at stackoverflow question Backbone js .listenTo vs .on (https://stackoverflow.com/q/16823746/983648). So the initialize would be written as: initialize: function() { this.listenTo( this.model, 'all', this.render ); } And also, I would recommend to use the get method available in model to access it's attribute, hence instead of accessing content by this.model.attributes.content use this.model.get( 'content' ).

      "6. `plt.imshow(out[..., 2])` displays the image using the blue channel as the color information.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. `plt.show()` renders the image.\n",
      "\n",
      "This code will create a 1920x1080 image where the pixel color at position (x, y) corresponds to the value in the blue channel at that position. Since the red and green channels are set to their respective indices, the resulting image will be a simple grid with varying shades of blue based on the random integer values.\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First, str(match_val) is not doing what you think it's doing. From the debugger: (Pdb) str(match_val) \"<re.Match object; span=(13, 15), match='15'>\" Secondly, the value of x is never being changed. sub() only returns the new string. Demonstrating in iPython: In [1]: import re In [2]: x = \"string\" In [3]: re.sub(\"ing\", \"ingthing\", x) Out[3]: 'stringthing' In [4]: x Out[4]: 'string' You'll also run into difficulty replacing the original value in a for... in loop. Third, you've got your arguments to sub() in the wrong order. It goes: regex, replacement string, original string. Fourth: Your original regex is kind of strange and probably not matching what you expect. \\s\\d\\d$ or \\s\\d{2}$ is probably closer to what you expect. One way to do this would be to use a capture group (parenthesis) and a backreference (a backslash and a digit) to do the substitution all in one go: import re list = [\"Tenochtitlan 1519\",\"Tetzcoco 20\",\"Tlacopan 21\"] new_list = [] for x in list: new_list.append(re.sub('\\s(\\d\\d)$', r' 15\\1', x)) for x in new_list: print(x) Output: Tenochtitlan 1519 Tetzcoco 1520 Tlacopan 1521\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth parameter of re.sub (http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.sub) is not flags, but replace count.

      "\n",
      "The replacement function is passed a match object (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#match-objects) by re.sub(). You return that match object directly, while you must return a string instead; after all that is what is going to be used to replace (substitute) the original match. You could return the matched text, via the MatchObject.group() method (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.MatchObject.group): print re.sub(r\"\\d+\", lambda x: x.group(), \"1 2 3 4 5\") You have not clearly stated you expected to happen, however; the above will return the original string, as it replaces each digit with itself: >>> re.sub(r\"\\d+\", lambda x: x.group(), \"1 2 3 4 5\") '1 2 3 4 5' or you could increment the number by one (which requires conversion to an integer, then after manipulation, conversion back to a string): >>> re.sub(r\"\\d+\", lambda x: str(int(x.group()) + 1), \"1 2 3 4 5\") '2 3 4 5 6'\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings are immutable. So, re.sub will create a new string. Instead, you can use list comprehension to create a new list with the replaced strings like this import re pattern = re.compile(r\"_\\d+\") print [pattern.sub(\"\", item) for item in data]\n",

      "Are you using python interactivly? In regular string you need to escape backslashes in your code, or use r\"...\" (Link to docs (http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals)). If you are running python interactivly and don't assign the results from your database to a variable, it'll be printed out using it's __repr__() method. >>> s = \"\\\\1abc\" >>> s '\\\\1abc' # <-- How it's represented in Python code >>> print s \\1abc # <-- The actual string Also, your re.sub is a bit weird. 1) Maybe you meant [0-9] as the pattern? (Matching a single digit). The arguments are probably switche too, if thereplacement is your input. This is the syntax: re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0) So my guess is you expect something like this: >>> s_in = yourDbMagic() # Which returns \\1abc >>> s_out = re.sub(\"[0-9]\", \"2\", s_in) >>> print s_in, s_out \\1abc \\2abc Edit: Tried to better explain escaping/representation.\n",

      "Your issue lies in the incorrect usage of `re.sub()`. Here are the corrections:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Argument Order**: The order of arguments in `re.sub()` is crucial. It should follow this pattern: `regex, replacement string, original string`. In your case, it seems like you might have reversed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Immutability of Strings**: Strings in Python are immutable, which means `re.sub()` creates a new string rather than modifying the existing one. Therefore, you need to store the result in a variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regex Pattern**: Your regex pattern `\\s\\d\\d$` matches any whitespace character followed by exactly two digits at the end of the string. If you want to match any two digits at the end of the string, regardless of the preceding characters, use `\\s\\d{2}$` instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Replacement Function**: If you want to increment the matched number by one, you need to convert it to an integer, perform the operation, and then convert it back to a string.\n",

Here is the fork of the provided fiddle that implements this approach: http://jsfiddle.net/u5vx1mLq/ (http://jsfiddle.net/u5vx1mLq/) In a nutshell, i18n component has path prop into which you can path a template string and tag prop which defines a tag, i18n component is to be replaced with. i18n also has a slot, which can be used to define a child component within which you can interpolate partials of the template string. Sorry for the awkward explanation, hopefully the code snippet will shed some light on this matter: const Home = { template: ` <div> <h1>{{ $t('home.title') }}</h1> <i18n path=\"home.linkLabel\" tag=\"label\" for=\"home.linkText\"> <router-link to=\"/post\">{{ $t('home.linkText') }}</router-link> </i18n> </div> ` }; const messages = { en: { home: { title: 'Hello world', linkText: 'this link', linkLabel: 'Find all post by clicking {0}' } } };\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to use v-model on the editor itself too or else it only receives the parent value but can't update it. However, you can't use the prop value for that because props can't be mutated (https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow). Using a computed setter (https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Computed-Setter) with v-model is a good solution here: <editor api-key=\"qagffr3pkuv17a8on1afax661irst1hbr4e6tbv888sz91jc\" v-model=\"model\" ></editor> Leave the value prop as is and add the computed: computed: { model: { get() { return this.value; }, set(val) { this.$emit('input', val); } } } The computed setter returns the prop when getting, but emits rather than setting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't expect v-model to implicitly update the underlying element for you. In other words, you'll still need to handle that within the component itself and expose modelValue (https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/v-model.html#_3-x-syntax) as a prop for this to really work. Something like that: <template> <input type=\"text\" @input=\"onChanged\" :value=\"modelValue\" :class=\"'input-text ' + additionalClass\" :placeholder=\"placeholder\" /> </template> <script> // InputText.vue import { defineComponent } from \"vue\" export default defineComponent({ name: 'InputText', emits: ['update:modelValue'], props: { modelValue: String, placeholder: { type: String, default: '' }, additionalClass: { type: String, default: '' } }, setup(props, { emit }) { function onChanged(e) { emit('update:modelValue', e.currentTarget.value); } return { onChanged } } }) </script>\n",
      "\n",
      "To enable the use of v-model the inner component must take a value property (https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Customizing-Component-v-model). Bind the value to the inner <input> using :value, not v-model (this would mutate the prop coming from the parent). And when the inner <input> is edited, emit an input event for the parent, to update its value (input event will update the variable the parent has on v-model). Also, if you have a default value for the type prop, declare it in props, not in the template. Here's how your code should be <template> <input :type=\"type\" :value=\"value\" @input=\"$emit('input', $event.target.value)\" class=\"v-input\" /> </template> <script> export default { props: { type: {default() { return 'text'; }}, value: {} // you can also add more restrictions here }, name: 'v-input' } </script> Info about what props can have: Components / Passing data With Props (https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Passing-Data-with-Props).

      "Forget that DZone article. Forget the Reactor pattern. Learn Asynchronous procedure call (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_procedure_call). There are 2 ways to split all the work in computer to parts: threads and tasks (in Java- tasks are Runnables). Tasks execute on a thread pool when they are ready. And when they are not ready, they do not occupy thread with its huge stack, and we can afford to have millions of tasks in single JVM instance, while 10000 threads in single JVM instance is problematic. The main problem with tasks is when task needs data which is not ready (not calculated by other task, or not yet arrived via network). In the thread world, the thread waiting for data executes a blocking operation like inputsream.read(), but tasks are not allowed to do this, or they would have occupied too many threads from thread pool and all advantages of task-based programming would be lost. So tasks are augmented with mechanisms which submit that task to the thread pool exactly when all their parameters arrived. Task with such a mechanism is called asynchronous procedure call. All the event-driven architectures are variants of asynchronous procedure call: Vert.x, RxJava, Project Reactor, Akka Actors etc. They just pretend to be something original and not always talk about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might find that Akka does what you need. Akka (http://akka.io/) uses actors as the implementation of business logic - these actors react to events produced by other actors. Akka provides this API and deals with the coordination of the actors - while Threads must be used underneath, the developer doesn't have to deal with them. The final benefit in the context of your question is that Akka can be distributed over multiple machines - I don't believe this change from single-machine to multiple-machine involves much if any modification of the program. I assume you need to ensure your events implement Serializable.\n",

      "A process engine is a state machine. The process model defines the possible states (events and tasks) and allowed transitions (sequence flows). The token flow represents the state of an instance of this model. There is a concept of sub processes and parallel states/execution/multiple tokens can be achieved by using parallel gateways, inclusive gateways, and non-interrupting events. You also have multi-version enactment at runtime. Camunda would nicely cover the requirement and would do so with the ability to configure the models in a graphical, business-friendly fashion (BPMN2). However, there wouldn't be anything left to implement for you. Maybe some task worker in python. If this is an academic exercise, then the idea is probably not to make an already implemented state machine work, but to roll your own.

      "This is about as classic a use case for reactive libraries as you might find! :) The key part of \"reactive\" architectures is that they can respond to events rather than wait for results. RxJava facilitates this via Observable and Reactor does this via several different mechanisms. In Reactor, you can use a plain Reactor and set a replyTo on the Event, you can use a Stream or a Promise to compose a chain of processing on values much like RxJava's Observable, you can use a Processor to do high-speed RingBuffer processing, or you can use a ForkJoinPool for doing simple fork/join style processing. That's a lot of options, for sure, but each one is designed to work in a particular use case without compromising for other use cases. Reactor the framework isn't a single, adjustable wrench. It's a set of wrenches sized exactly for what you need. In this particular case the important part is the parallelism achieved by doing lots of work concurrently since your datasource IO is presumably blocking the thread. RxJava has a pluggable execution model but it's fairly coarse-grained. One of Reactor's strengths is the efficient, fine-grained task dispatching support and the ease with which you can react to results. Since your use case is pretty straightforward and much closer to a standard ThreadPoolExecutor situation, I might be tempted to use the ForkJoinPool in Reactor 1.1 (https://github.com/reactor/reactor/blob/master/reactor-core/src/test/java/reactor/core/fork/ForkJoinPoolTests.java#L40) (which is brand new). The ForkJoinPool provides you with a single Promise<ImmutableList<T>> that joins the results of all the tasks you submit to the pool, which is backed by a standard ThreadPoolExecutor. It's basically a \"reactive\" wrapper around a standard thread pool so requires very little overhead but provides the flexibility of reacting to the completion of all submitted tasks. It's similar to RxJava's Observable.merge().\n",

      "design patterns are \"recipes\" intended to be used to solve known problems. for example, if you need to notify an object, when another one changes, you can use the observer pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern). In your situation it seems you might need to rework a bit your architecture, trying to identify the points that can be abstracted with a design pattern. For example, if you are in the situation in which you receive a lot of events, and you need to keep track and react to a particular sequence, maybe it's worth to consider state pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) or the strategy pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern). In general the idea is to try both to identify known patterns, and to try to model your software so that you can fall in a known case, that is solved by a design pattern.\n",

      "This is the output i'm getting ã‚¬ãƒ?ãƒ¼ã‚·ãƒ¥ in place of ガネーシュ That tells you that somewhere in this process, data in UTF-8 is being read by a piece of software that thinks it is reading Latin-1. What it doesn't tell you is where in the process this is happening. So you need to divide-and-conquer - you need to find the last point at which the data is correct. Start by establishing whether the problem is before the transformation or after it. That's very easy if you're using an XSLT 2.0 processor: you can use ` to see what string of characters the XSLT processor has been given. It's a bit trickier with a 1.0 processor, but you can use substring($in, $n, 1) to extract the nth character, and that should give you a clue. My suspicion is that it's the input. Firstly, putting non-ASCII characters in a Java string literal is always a bit dangerous, because the round trip to a source repository can easily corrupt the code if you're not very careful about everything being configured correctly. Secondly, if the string is correct, it would be much safer to read it using a StringReader, rather than converting it to a byte stream. Try: transformer.transform(new StreamSource( new StringReader(SXmlFileData)),outResult);\n",
      "\n",
      "Rupesh, you are treating UTF-8 encoded data as signle-byte coded data or encoding UTF-8 twice. (the out.toString(\"UTF-8\") ???) First step is to figure out, what encoding is your data in and what encoding are you supposed to produce. For instance if you use Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), it has a menu \"Encoding\" where it shows you the current encoding of the file and allows you to change it, see the effect. Tell us what's the story. You might be after the western european windows ecoding: windows-1252 Check this as well: the encoding attribute of the XSL output element (http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/el_output.asp) I could give you some sample in C# if you like, but you run Java...\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a Java String with Unicode characters than the right way to feed them to the XML parser/JAXP Transformer would be a StreamSource over a StringReader i.e. StreamSource src = new StreamSource(new StringReader(xml));. You haven't shown how you construct the String xml but once you have a String with the characters use a StringReader. Of course, if you have a file, use a StreamSource over a FileInputStream, all attempts to guess encoding and do the decoding by hand are not necessary and error-prone, an XML parser is usually pretty good at detecting the encoding based on the XML declaration and decoding as necessary. As you also want a String for the transformation result I would additionally recommend a StreamResult over a StringWriter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A string contains characters. The encoding is irrelevant until you transform the string into bytes. This happens when you call String.getBytes(), or when you write the String to a stream (file, socket, whatever). Make sure you use an OutputStreamWriter to write your XML string, and that you specify UTF-8 as charset when constructing this OutputStreamWriter. If you're using a dedicated marshalling API like JAXB, set the appropriate property so that the UTF-8 encoding is used, and the generated XML contains its encoding (in the <?xml ...?> header) . Without knowing which API you're using to generate your XML string, it's hard to be more helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's likely Spring which has transformed Unicode characters (at least, the non-ISO-8859-1 characters) into XML entities. This behaviour must be configureable somewhere in the Spring settings (or those of the web based MVC framework you're actually using in combination with Spring but didn't mention about). Since I don't do Spring, I can't go in detail about configuring this. But if you can't figure it for ever, then you may consider to use Apache Commons Lang (http://commons.apache.org/lang/) StringEscapeUtils#unescapeXml() (http://commons.apache.org/lang/api/org/apache/commons/lang/StringEscapeUtils.html#unescapeXml%28java.lang.String%29) to manually unescape the XML entities into real Arabic glyphs. String realFilename = StringEscapeUtils.unescapeXml(escapedFilename);\n",

      "This (http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/excerpt/java_xslt_ch5/index.html?page=4) article might help you. Basically, you call setOutputProperty with OutputKeys.ENCODING as key and the desired encoding (\"UTF-16\") as value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setEncoding method says what the encoding actually is, not what you want it to be. The XML library won't convert the characters. See this question: Meaning of XML encoding (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13743250/meaning-of-xml-version-1-0-encoding-utf-8/27398439#27398439) If you want to convert the encoding, that is another question.\n",

      "Using innerHTML to insert scripts leads to errors\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't a job for innerHTML. You should probably load the external file as a DOM object (which is the origin of the XMLHTTPRequest name) so the script tag is turned into the proper object before getting added. A quick experiment with Firefox using jQuery (on this page, heh) shows that innerHTML will add a script element that doesn't get executed, whereas this does execute: $( 'body' ).append( $('<script>console.log( \"hello, world!\" );</script>' ) );\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot inject a <script> element using .innerHTML and expect it to evaluate. You must use either eval or document.write or inject the <script> into the DOM the \"normal\" way. With dynamic scripts, eval is recommended. Remember that eval evaluates pure JavaScript and does not use the HTML interpreter. (Contrast this with PHP's default behaviour, where eval is like inserting ?>$string<?php into the document.) Also remember that a script terminates when it approaches </script>. It's strange to be inserting </script> into JavaScript anyway (unless you're using the document.write method, which has many problems and should be avoided where size isn't an extreme issue). Here's an example of using eval: var script = 'alert(\"test\");'; eval(script); If you want to inject a script into the DOM with other elements, you need to extract the <script> element after injecting and execute the (internal or external) script. Frameworks like jQuery and Prototype do this automatically, which is one of the many reasons why they are recommended over vanilla JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "JavaScript is not evaluated when inserted with innerHTML. You either need to eval() it yourself or append a new external script tag to the page.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the MDN reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) HTML5 specifies that a <script> tag inserted with innerHTML should not execute. You'll need to separate the scripts from the HTML content and either include them as part of the code that loads the content, or place them in their own script file that is loaded separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess you're using something like element.innerHTML = '<script src=\"...\"></script>';. That is not going to work since script elements are never evaluated when setting the innerHTML of an element. To include a script dynamically, use something in the sense of: var script = document.createElement(\"script\"); script.src = \"...\"; document.body.appendChild(script); You can make your webapp output the URL's to be loaded or use regular expressions to attempt to parse the scripts out of the response.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like that your <script> tag is being added as you expect, but the code within it is not being executed. The same failure happens if you try using document.head (or any other DOM element, it seems). For whatever reason (possibly standards compliance, possible security), inline code inside of <script> blocks that are added via .innerHTML simply doesn't run. However, I do have working code that produces similar functionality: var script = document.createElement('script'); script[(script.innerText===undefined?\"textContent\":\"innerText\")] = 'alert(1);'; document.documentElement.appendChild(script); Here, you add the <script> block with documentElement.appendChild and use textContent or innerText to set the content of the <script>.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think your issue is that innerHTML is not intended for use on script tags. var contentScript = document.createElement(\"script\"); contentScript.setAttribute(\"id\", \"contentSCRIPT\"); contentScript.text = \"alert('test');\"; document.getElementById(\"main\").appendChild(contentScript);\n",
      "\n",
      "When you insert scripts in content via innerHTML, those scripts don't get run by the browser. If you want them to run, then you need to find the scripts in that content, get the text from them and insert them into new scripts that are then inserted into the document. As long as the scripts don't need to run in place using document.write(), this will work just fine and libraries like jQuery do this for you automatically when inserting HTML into the document. Here's a basic demo for how it works: http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/2tRQW/ (http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/2tRQW/) // insert dynamic content that has a script in it // simulate what's happening with your ajax call var s = 'Hello<s' + 'cript>alert(\"Hello\"); document.getElementById(\"result\").style.color = \"red\";</s' + 'cript>'; var obj = document.getElementById(\"result\"); obj.innerHTML = s; // find the script tags in that dynamic content var scripts = obj.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"); // create new script tags that you can copy the script content over to // and then insert the new script tags into the document to make the browser // actually run the scripts var head = document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0]; for (var i = 0; i < scripts.length; i++) { var oldScript = scripts[i].parentNode.removeChild(scripts[i]); var newScript = document.createElement(\"script\"); newScript.type = \"text/javascript\"; newScript.textContent = oldScript.textContent; head.appendChild(newScript); }\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not enough to simply set the innerHTML to something that contains a script tag. You must create a script element and append it to the DOM. I believe the intent is to give some cross site scripting protection when injecting massive blobs of content. var script = document.createElement('script'); script.innerHTML = \"alert('ran some JS');\"; document.body.appendChild(script); Example: http://jsfiddle.net/axvaT/ (http://jsfiddle.net/axvaT/) document.write won't work like you think though. document.write will not place text where the script tag is. Instead it will place text where the HTML parser is currently looking at. Depending on when the JS code is run, these may be the same, or maybe entirely different. So for this reason, among others, never use document.write for anything. Ever. Even debugging. Lastly, while sometimes it's useful to inject a script tag pointing to some other js file: var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = 'somefile.js'; document.head.appendChild(script); Doing this with a script tag that has JS in it makes no sense. You are using javascript to create a script tag that should immediately run some javascript. Why not just run that javascript that you want to run away instead of creating a new script tag to do it for you? So don't do: var script = document.createElement('script'); script.innerHTML = \"alert('ran some JS');\"; document.body.appendChild(script); Instead just do: alert('ran some JS');\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[1] GUIs are polling based? GUIs are event based -- everything that happens in a GUI is a response to an event. How the application handles the event is up to the application. If the handling of the event can happen in a few hundred milliseconds or less it can be handled in the main thread. If it is going to take longer, the application should run the code in a separate thread or process. In the case of Tkinter, Tkinter is designed to run in a single thread. That doesn't mean you can't use threads, only that all access to tkinter objects should be on a single thread. The common way to do this is for other threads to communicate with the GUI via a thread-safe queue, and the GUI thread is responsible for checking that queue periodically. So my question is, Is there an option like [root.setInterruptMode(True)] In tkinter, no, there is no way to enter a special \"interrupt\" mode. [2] It is just a gigantic loop? I assume by \"it\" you mean the call to mainloop. Yes, it's a gigantic loop. Or perhaps more correctly, it's a tiny loop. All it does is wait for an event, then it looks up the handler for the event and runs the handler. My impression is that mainloop() doesn't really start a thread or anything in python Correct. It runs the event loop in the current thread. [3] why putting mainloop in Main line? You would have to ask the original developers that. Likely it's because that's all that is necessary for a very, very large percentage of applications (perhaps more true back when the toolkit was invented than it is now). Tkinter is nothing but a wrapper around a tcl interpreter with the tk toolkit loaded in the interpreter. tcl/tk was designed to be embedded in other applications, so it needed to be lightweight, and be able to run on systems that don't support threads (tcl is old enough that thread support wasn't guaranteed on every platform) Does mainloop() have to reside in the Main line? can I thread/multiprocess it out? mainloop() needs to be run in the same thread that created the root window. If you need threads (and again, it's quite possible that you don't), you can certainly run your event handlers in a separate thread. It adds complexity, but it's there if you need it. For a large class of programs, there's simply no need for that much complexity. You should be able to create a worker thread and create and run your GUI from there. I've never tried it, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work. Tkinter doesn't care that it's the main thread, only that all tkinter code runs in the same thread. All the examples I came across have mainloop() in the Main line, I am not sure it is a recommended approach or what the benefits are. Calling mainloop in the main thread is how tkinter was designed to work. If you have long running calculations, you should put those calculations in a separate thread or process.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am confused about the mainloop(). What exactly is looping? Tkinter maintains a queue of events. mainloop loops over that queue, pulling items off and executing functions bound to the events. If this program was looping through class Test ... It doesn't loop through your code. There is an internal, constantly updating list of events. mainloop loops over that list. It doesn't loop over your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "What code does the mainloop processes infinitely? Like does it read the code of the entire program again and again? No. Via this function (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/83d544b9292870eb44f6fca37df0aa351c4ef83a/Lib/tkinter/__init__.py#L1455-L1457), it calls this C code (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/83d544b9292870eb44f6fca37df0aa351c4ef83a/Modules/_tkinter.c#L2722-L2773) which has the embedded Tcl interpreter process one event, or wait for Tkinter_busywaitinterval before trying to process another event Now, even this code executes the same output, so now we can consider the mainloop() loops the code \"window.update()\" infite number of times, but more efficiently(somehow). window.update() (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/83d544b9292870eb44f6fca37df0aa351c4ef83a/Lib/tkinter/__init__.py#L1340-L1342) calls TCL update (https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/update.html), which is described to [...] bring the application “up to date” by entering the event loop repeatedly until all pending events (including idle callbacks) have been processed. Your infinite loop doesn't have a sleep, so it's spinning your CPU as hard as possible to do practically nothing. [...] Does it re-read the code from top to bottom again, or how does the update function update the GUI widget vaules. It certainly doesn't re-read your code. It processes any pending widget updates, which may have happened by running e.g. window.text(\"...\") in e.g. a click callback or an .after() timeout, etc. I read this article [...] That article seems wrong and/or at least over-simplifies things. This simple example clock should clarify how things work: import time import tkinter as tk root = tk.Tk() text = tk.Label(root) text.pack() def tick(): text[\"text\"] = time.ctime() # update `text` widget's content root.after(1000, tick) # schedule for this function to be called after 1 second if __name__ == '__main__': tick() # call the `tick` function once before entering main loop root.mainloop()\n",
      "\n",
      "The mainloop() method runs the event processing loop on the current thread until all windows started in the thread have closed or the quit() method is called (which internally sets a flag that is checked by the core event loop runner). It blocks the thread, except that it does all the registered callbacks as necessary. The underlying machinery is not actually associated with any particular window, but rather with a thread. It's just that Tkinter prefers to not map things as free functions, despite that really being what they are. You're pretty strongly recommended to not have the results of two calls to tkinter.Tk() active at once. It works, but the result can be quite confusing. It can get even more confusing if you do it from several threads at once (which is supposed to work — except on macOS for messy reasons — but the results tend to be mind-bending). (This does not apply to tkinter.Tcl(); that does work reasonably when done multiple times, and from multiple threads. The object it produces is thread-bound, but having many instances is sensible, and you can have those instances either in their own threads or together.) What doing two calls to tkinter.Tk() like you've done does is create two separate underlying Tcl/Tk environments (the technical term is an “interpreter” even though that's got a bytecode compiler and so on) sharing a thread. This is sensible from a Tcl/Tk perspective due to the very different security model that Tcl uses, but it's almost total nonsense from the view of Python. The effects are describable small-scale operationally, but making broader sense of them is very difficult, and you're advised to not try.\n",

      "Will mainloop() continually update while it waits for another button press, or will I essentially have to creatre an update method that cycles through everything until another button is pressed?

      "\n",
      "Doing a bit more research, I'm pretty sure my comment is correct. The UI updates all widgets as needed every time through the event loop. Calling update basically just forces it to run the event loop now. So, if you're in the middle of an event callback, you're recursively entering the event loop, which is a very bad thing, and can lead to infinite recursion. As The TkInter Book (http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/widget.htm#Tkinter.Widget.update-method) says, update: Processes all pending events, calls event callbacks, completes any pending geometry management, redraws widgets as necessary, and calls all pending idle tasks. This method should be used with care, since it may lead to really nasty race conditions if called from the wrong place (from within an event callback, for example, or from a function that can in any way be called from an event callback, etc.). When in doubt, use update_idletasks instead. Similarly, the TkInter reference (http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/universal.html) says: This method forces the updating of the display. It should be used only if you know what you're doing, since it can lead to unpredictable behavior or looping. It should never be called from an event callback or a function that is called from an event callback. Testing things out, it seems like at least in some cases, TkInter just ignores you when you call update from inside the event loop. Presumably to protect you from infinite recursion, but I haven't looked at the code to verify that. At any rate, this isn't the function you want, so it doesn't really matter why exactly it isn't doing what it wasn't documented to do. If you need to trigger an update from within an event callback, call update_idletasks. This actually calls all pending \"idle\" tasks, including redraws, without calling any event callbacks. (Not \"update next time we're in the event loop and have nothing else to do\".) Meanwhile, calling raw_input inside an event callback is even worse. You're blocking the main event loop on terminal input. Unless this was just something you did for debugging purposes, it's a very bad idea. And even for debugging purposes, it's a very odd thing to test, and it's entirely plausible that whatever happens will have no relevance to normal behavior. For more background, see the question TkInter: How do widgets update (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5781286/tkinter-how-do-widgets-update), or search update_idletasks on this site, or look at some of the Related links on the right side (at least two of which are relevant). Based on your edit, as it turns out, it sounds like you had kind of the opposite problem—you were just changing things without telling TkInter to do anything about it, so the changes wouldn't show up until the next time through the event loop (which means not until after you return from this function). But the answer is basically the same—one way it's \"replace your call to update with update_idletasks\", the other way it's \"add a call to update_idletasks\".\n",

      "The mainloop is simply what is run once you are satisfied with the current state of all of your widgets and environment and are prepared to hand control of the app to the user. Without the mainloop your program would build the widget, display it on the screen, then there would be no further instructions so the application would end and your window would be destroyed.

      "The `mainloop()` function in tkinter is the core component of the GUI event loop. It runs indefinitely, waiting for events such as user interactions (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses), system events (e.g., timer expirations), or other external stimuli. When an event occurs, tkinter dispatches it to the appropriate widget and executes the corresponding event handler function, which you have previously defined using methods like `bind()`, `command`, or `after()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, `mainloop()` creates a loop that constantly checks for new events and processes them accordingly. Internally, tkinter maintains a queue of pending events and polls this queue continuously to detect new events. Once an event is detected, tkinter retrieves its associated handler function and invokes it. This allows tkinter to respond to user actions and maintain a responsive interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize, `mainloop()` is responsible for:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Monitoring the event queue for incoming events.\n",
      "2. Detecting and dispatching events to the appropriate widgets.\n",
      "3. Executing the associated event handler functions.\n",
      "4. Continuously repeating these steps until the application is terminated (by calling `quit()` or when all windows are closed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding threading concerns: Since tkinter is designed to operate in a single thread, all GUI operations must occur on the same thread where the `mainloop()` is running. Any multi-threading or multiprocessing should be limited to non-GUI activities, such as performing heavy computations, network requests, or accessing external resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that calling `update()` or `update_idletasks()` directly can lead to issues, such as infinite recursion or unexpected behavior, especially when invoked within an event handler. Instead, let tkinter manage the event loop and widget updates automatically by focusing on defining proper event bindings and handlers.\n",

      "Please understand that you do not have complete control over if or when paint(...) get's called, and that repaint() calls are only a suggestion to the JVM to paint. If too many repaint() requests come in and they stack up as yours are doing, then they will be combined. For more details on this, please have a look at this article, Painting in AWT and Swing (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/painting-140037.html). Regardless, even if your code worked, it still wouldn't cause any visible changes for the user of your code, since all the x and y changes and painting would be done almost instantaneously. Perhaps you really want to use a Swing Timer? Perhaps you want to re-code this in Swing and not AWT as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like you're using Swing, and if your question is how to get a game loop out of an application using the basics of Swing (an application not using BufferStrategy, but a combination of different Swing components), then you roughly want the following: An object that represent the games state (can be further abstracted down into more objects of course) A custom JComponent that has a reference to that object, which draws the object in someway during a repaint (can be further abstracted down into more JComponents that help draw the state, custom or not) A java.util.Timer that also has a reference to that object, which updates the game based on how much time has elapsed since the last update, and that eventually calls repaint The custom JComponent you create can have listeners on various buttons or other things such as mouse clicks, where you can use the same reference to the game state object you use to draw to update the game's state based on the UI actions. Make sure your code is thread safe too as the repaint executing on the EDT, or one of your Swing listeners, can occur at the same time you update your state with the Timer object. If you search online for example usage of game loops in Java using BufferStrategy you'll find more traditional game loop examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you read the documentation of repaint (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Component.html#repaint%28%29) carefully, you will notice that it states that (emphasis mine): If this component is a lightweight component, this method causes a call to this component's paint method as soon as possible. Otherwise, this method causes a call to this component's update method as soon as possible. This means that AWT/Swing is allowed to optimize repainting by merging repaints that are requested in a rapid succession. There is also a repaint(long time) (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Component.html#repaint%28long%29) method, which allows you to control how long AWT/Swing is allowed to wait with fullfilling your repaint request. It might still merge requests though, especially if you do them in a loop. It might be helpful to read the article \"Painting in AWT and Swing\" (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/painting-140037.html), which tries to explain the various concepts involved. To get the panel repainted for every iteration, you would have to wait for a paint to happen and then proceed with your loop. This means you need some synchronization between your processing thread (the loop) and the AWT/Swing thread. As a rough idea, you could for example wait() (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#wait%28%29) on the panel object at the end of your loop if it has not been repainted since the last call to repaint() and call notifyAll() (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#notifyAll%28%29) at the end of your panel's paintComponent() method. However, this can be tricky to implement right, so you should only do this if you really need \"real-time\" redrawing of your component. As an alternative, paintImmediately(...) (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#paintImmediately%28int,%20int,%20int,%20int%29) could be used, but you would have to do all your processing in the event dispatching thread, like this: SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { while(notDone) { // Do your processing panel.paintImmediately(...); } } }); Note that this will stop any event processing including mouse and keyboard input from being processed while your loop is running. You can read more about Swing and Threading in \"Concurrency in Swing\" (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to repaint at a certain interval, javax.swing.Timer is probably the class for you. In the specific case of repaint you can call it from a non-EDT thread, but you may get yourself into difficulty as you are now dealing with multiple threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are wanting to schedule the updates at a set interval, javax.swing.Timer (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/Timer.html) provides a Swing-integrated service for it. Timer runs its task on the EDT periodically, without having an explicit loop. (An explicit loop would block the EDT from processing events, which would freeze the UI. I explained this more in-depth here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/29837148/2891664).) Ultimately doing any kind of painting in Swing you'll still be doing two things: Overriding paintComponent to do your drawing. Calling repaint as-needed to request that your drawing be made visible. (Swing normally only repaints when it's needed, for example when some other program's window passes over top of a Swing component.) If you're doing those two things you're probably doing it right. Swing doesn't really have a high-level API for animation. It's designed primarily with drawing GUI components in mind. It can certainly do some good stuff, but you will have to write a component mostly from scratch, like you're doing. Painting in AWT and Swing (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/painting-140037.html) covers some of the 'behind the scenes' stuff if you do not have it bookmarked. You might look in to JavaFX. I don't know that much about it personally, but it's supposed to be more geared towards animation. As somewhat of an optimization, one thing that can be done is to paint on a separate image and then paint the image on to the panel in paintComponent. This is especially useful if the painting is long: repaints can be scheduled by the system so this keeps when it happens more under control. If you aren't drawing to an image, then you'd need to build a model with objects, and paint all of them every time inside paintComponent. Here's an example of drawing to an image: import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.image.*; import java.awt.event.*; /** * Holding left-click draws, and * right-clicking cycles the color. */ class PaintAnyTime { public static void main(String[] args) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { new PaintAnyTime(); } }); } Color[] colors = {Color.red, Color.blue, Color.black}; int currentColor = 0; BufferedImage img = new BufferedImage(256, 256, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB); Graphics2D imgG2 = img.createGraphics(); JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"Paint Any Time\"); JPanel panel = new JPanel() { @Override protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) { super.paintComponent(g); // Creating a copy of the Graphics // so any reconfiguration we do on // it doesn't interfere with what // Swing is doing. Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g.create(); // Drawing the image. int w = img.getWidth(); int h = img.getHeight(); g2.drawImage(img, 0, 0, w, h, null); // Drawing a swatch. Color color = colors[currentColor]; g2.setColor(color); g2.fillRect(0, 0, 16, 16); g2.setColor(Color.black); g2.drawRect(-1, -1, 17, 17); // At the end, we dispose the // Graphics copy we've created g2.dispose(); } @Override public Dimension getPreferredSize() { return new Dimension(img.getWidth(), img.getHeight()); } }; MouseAdapter drawer = new MouseAdapter() { boolean rButtonDown; Point prev; @Override public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { if (SwingUtilities.isLeftMouseButton(e)) { prev = e.getPoint(); } if (SwingUtilities.isRightMouseButton(e) && !rButtonDown) { // (This just behaves a little better // than using the mouseClicked event.) rButtonDown = true; currentColor = (currentColor + 1) % colors.length; panel.repaint(); } } @Override public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { if (prev != null) { Point next = e.getPoint(); Color color = colors[currentColor]; // We can safely paint to the // image any time we want to. imgG2.setColor(color); imgG2.drawLine(prev.x, prev.y, next.x, next.y); // We just need to repaint the // panel to make sure the // changes are visible // immediately. panel.repaint(); prev = next; } } @Override public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) { if (SwingUtilities.isLeftMouseButton(e)) { prev = null; } if (SwingUtilities.isRightMouseButton(e)) { rButtonDown = false; } } }; PaintAnyTime() { // RenderingHints let you specify // options such as antialiasing. imgG2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON); imgG2.setStroke(new BasicStroke(3)); // panel.setBackground(Color.white); panel.addMouseListener(drawer); panel.addMouseMotionListener(drawer); Cursor cursor = Cursor.getPredefinedCursor(Cursor.CROSSHAIR_CURSOR); panel.setCursor(cursor); frame.setContentPane(panel); frame.pack(); frame.setResizable(false); frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.setVisible(true); } } (https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7yYF.png) If the routine is long-running and repaints could happen concurrently, double buffering can also be used. Drawing is done to an image which is separate from the one being shown. Then, when the drawing routine is done, the image references are swapped so the update is seamless. You should typically use double buffering for a game, for example. Double buffering prevents the image from being shown in a partial state. This could happen if, for example, you were using a background thread for the game loop (instead of a Timer) and a repaint happened the game was doing the painting. Without double buffering, this kind of situation would result in flickering or tearing. Swing components are double buffered by default, so if all of your drawing is happening on the EDT you don't need to write double buffering logic yourself. Swing already does it. Here is a somewhat more complicated example which shows a long-running task and a buffer swap: import java.awt.*; import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.image.*; import java.awt.event.*; import java.util.*; /** * Left-click to spawn a new background * painting task. */ class DoubleBuffer { public static void main(String[] args) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { new DoubleBuffer(); } }); } final int width = 640; final int height = 480; BufferedImage createCompatibleImage() { GraphicsConfiguration gc = GraphicsEnvironment .getLocalGraphicsEnvironment() .getDefaultScreenDevice() .getDefaultConfiguration(); // createCompatibleImage creates an image that is // optimized for the display device. // See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/GraphicsConfiguration.html#createCompatibleImage-int-int-int- return gc.createCompatibleImage(width, height, Transparency.TRANSLUCENT); } // The front image is the one which is // displayed in the panel. BufferedImage front = createCompatibleImage(); // The back image is the one that gets // painted to. BufferedImage back = createCompatibleImage(); boolean isPainting = false; final JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"Double Buffer\"); final JPanel panel = new JPanel() { @Override protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) { super.paintComponent(g); // Scaling the image to fit the panel. Dimension actualSize = getSize(); int w = actualSize.width; int h = actualSize.height; g.drawImage(front, 0, 0, w, h, null); } }; final MouseAdapter onClick = new MouseAdapter() { @Override public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { if (!isPainting) { isPainting = true; new PaintTask(e.getPoint()).execute(); } } }; DoubleBuffer() { panel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(width, height)); panel.setBackground(Color.WHITE); panel.addMouseListener(onClick); frame.setContentPane(panel); frame.pack(); frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.setVisible(true); } void swap() { BufferedImage temp = front; front = back; back = temp; } class PaintTask extends SwingWorker<Void, Void> { final Point pt; PaintTask(Point pt) { this.pt = pt; } @Override public Void doInBackground() { Random rand = new Random(); synchronized(DoubleBuffer.this) { Graphics2D g2 = back.createGraphics(); g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON); g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_STROKE_CONTROL, RenderingHints.VALUE_STROKE_PURE); g2.setBackground(new Color(0, true)); g2.clearRect(0, 0, width, height); // (This computes pow(2, rand.nextInt(3) + 7).) int depth = 1 << ( rand.nextInt(3) + 7 ); float hue = rand.nextInt(depth); int radius = 1; int c; // This loop just draws concentric circles, // starting from the inside and extending // outwards until it hits the outside of // the image. do { int rgb = Color.HSBtoRGB(hue / depth, 1, 1); g2.setColor(new Color(rgb)); int x = pt.x - radius; int y = pt.y - radius; int d = radius * 2; g2.drawOval(x, y, d, d); ++radius; ++hue; c = (int) (radius * Math.cos(Math.PI / 4)); } while ( (0 <= pt.x - c) || (pt.x + c < width) || (0 <= pt.y - c) || (pt.y + c < height) ); g2.dispose(); back.flush(); return (Void) null; } } @Override public void done() { // done() is completed on the EDT, // so for this small program, this // is the only place where synchronization // is necessary. // paintComponent will see the swap // happen the next time it is called. synchronized(DoubleBuffer.this) { swap(); } isPainting = false; panel.repaint(); } } } The painting routine is just intended draw garbage which takes a long time: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUOf0.png)\n",

Read the section from the Swing tutorial on Concurrency (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/TOC.html) for a complete explanation of this concept. When you use a Swing Timer, the event is executed in the EDT so you can just tell a component to repaint itself at a new location. When you use a Thread, then the looping is done off the EDT and you need to use SwingUtilities.invokeLater(...) to place the painting code back on the EDT. In general, if you code is simply moving a component from one location to another then it is probably easiest to use a Timer. However, if you game involves lots of complex logic, then you don't want that logic to execute on the EDT since it will prevent the GUI from responding to events and repainting itself. In that case you might want to use a Thread.\n",

      "Don't paint onto a top level container (like JFrame), they do not support double buffering. Instead, use something like a JPanel Convention prefers overriding paintComponent rather then paint. This is done mostly because paint is a actually a very complex method NEVER do this in any paint method: try { Thread.sleep(75); } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} repaint(); Firstly, any delays should be handled by the game thread, calling Thread#sleep within the paint method will put the Event Dispatching Thread to sleep, which will prevent it from posting events (about mouse and keyboard interactions) and will make your program look non-responsive, which will cause you issues later on. Never call repaint (or any method that might call repaint) from inside a paint method. This is simply asking the repaint manager to schedule another paint cycle, which will chew up your CPU until you program becomes unresponsive. Again, this is function of your game thread. Remember, Swing is NOT thread save. All interactions with the UI MUST be made from within the context of the Event Dispatching Thread.

      "Eventually you'll want to move to something like LWJGL (http://www.lwjgl.org/), but let me stress, keep doing what you're doing here for now. It will teach you fundamentals. Good job on your loop. Looks nice, let me offer a few pointers: Repaint will not render the screen immediately. It tells the RepaintManager (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/RepaintManager.html) to render when its ready. Use invalidate paintImmediately (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#paintImmediately%28int,%20int,%20int,%20int%29) instead. paintImmediately will block execution until the component has been redrawn so you can measure rendering time. Thread.sleep typically has a few milliseconds drift. You should be using it to keep your loop from using too much CPU, but make sure you understand if you sleep 10 milliseconds you might sleep 5 milliseconds or you might sleep 20. Lastly: double delta = updateLength / ((double)OPTIMAL_TIME); If updateLength is less than OPTIMAL_TIME, don't call update. In other words, if delta is less than one, don't update.

      "Using `repaint()` alone is generally not recommended for implementing a game loop due to several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lack of Control**: You don't have direct control over when `repaint()` is actually executed. The JVM optimizes repainting by merging multiple repaint requests, which can lead to inconsistent frame rates and performance issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread Safety**: `repaint()` is not thread-safe. If you attempt to update the state of your game and repaint simultaneously, you risk race conditions and other threading issues.\n",

      "The answer can be found looking at the documentation: From the source code of Socket.IO (https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/f1b39a6b1d0f30c4dce63a6b2a2aa9d839483285/docs/API.md#socketoneventname-callback): socket.on(eventName, callback) (inherited from EventEmitter) From here (http://davidvgalbraith.com/fixed-node-js/): Internally, the EventEmitter keeps track of an object called this.events that maps event names to arrays of event handlers. When a program calls the on method with an event name and event handler, the EventEmitter adds the handler to the array for that event name. So basically, the socket keeps a map of events, keyed by name, to an array of functions that are called when that event is received. And if you look at the documentation (https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener) of EventEmitter.on, you'll see that it is pretty dumb - it does not check that you aren't adding the same function twice: .on() -> Adds the listener function to the end of the listeners array for the event named eventName. No checks are made to see if the listener has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of eventName and listener will result in the listener being added, and called, multiple times.\n",

      "Updated There are two things here. 1. Using the EventEmitter API I think you're asking why ee1 !== ee2 using the API. They're different because the API (https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_events) let's you create as many EventEmitter's as you like. This let's you have an EventEmitter for multiple sockets, streams, db connections, or whatever you need. You could think of new EventEmitter() as a factory stamping out EventEmitter's 2. If you're asking about this specific code, there's a bug in the 2nd version. The bug is due to JavaScript's Operator Order (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence). Tl;DR, you need ()'s around the . for a one-line new: var ee4 = new (require('events').EventEmitter); ( . ) <-- do . before new The issue is that new and . have the same precidence so are evaluated left-to-right. That precedence puts it above or below the . operator after require('events'). This code helped me understand better node test.js: var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter; console.log('require(\\'events\\').EventEmitter: ' + EventEmitter); // Works var ee1 = new EventEmitter; console.log('ee1: new EventEmitter: ' + ee1); // Works var ee1a = new EventEmitter(); console.log('ee1a: new EventEmitter(): ' + ee1a); // Desn't work.

      "The issue you're encountering is related to how the `on` method works in your custom `Emitter` class. When you call `emtr.on('greet', function() {...})` twice, it overwrites the existing array of listeners for the 'greet' event with a new array containing only the second listener. This behavior is due to the line `this.events[type] = [];` in the `on` method, which resets the array for each event type every time a new listener is added.\n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain all registered listeners for each event type, you should modify the `on` method to append the listener to the existing array instead of replacing it. Here's the corrected version of your `Emitter` class:\n",

      "This has the advantage of being O(n) (sorting a string is O(n log n)). A character (or string) in Python is \"less than\" another character if it comes before it in alphabetical order, so in order to see if a string is in alphabetical order we just need to compare each pair of adjacent characters. Also, note that you take range(len(word) - 1) instead of range(len(word)) because otherwise you will overstep the bounds of the string on the last iteration of the loop. def isInAlphabeticalOrder(word): for i in range(len(word) - 1): if word[i] > word[i + 1]: return False return True\n",

Now instead you're sorting based on the result of the booleans returned by islower and the strings themselves (which seems to be what you want): [(not s.islower(), s) for s in d] # [(True, 'AAab'), (False, 'abc'), (True, 'Ejc'), (False, 'badad1')]\n",

      "In modern Python, the best way is to use list.sort or sorted with key argument. When you pass key argument, sorting function, instead of comparing elements directly, compares whatever key returned for them. So, you can pass as key any callable that takes element to be sorted as single positional argument, and returns what the element should be sorted by. The callable will be called once for each element. Some simple examples: list_ = ['B', 'aaa', 'CC'] sorted(list_) => ['B', 'CC', 'aaa'] # case-insensitive sorting sorted(list_, key=str.lower) => ['aaa', 'B', 'CC'] # sorting by length sorted(list_, key=len) => ['B', 'CC', 'aaa'] Sorting with key is roughly equivalent to Decorate-Sort-Undecorate pattern (https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting#The_Old_Way_Using_Decorate-Sort-Undecorate): def decorate_sort_undecorate(iterable, key): # 1: decorate: decorated = [(key(elem), index, elem) for index, elem in enumerate(iterable)] # 2: sort: decorated.sort() # 3: undecorate: return [elem for key_, index, elem in decorated] This creates temporary list (decorated) of 3-element tuples, which have form: (key_, index, elem), where key_ = key(elem). Then, decorated list is sorted. Tuples are compared by first non-equal element. This is key_, or if key_s are equal, index. Because there are no equal indexes, elements are never directly compared. At the end, elements are extracted from decorated into new list, which is returned. Random thoughts: Order of sorted elements can be reversed using reverse=True, lambdas (https://stackoverflow.com/q/8966538/3821804) and functions from operator module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) are often passed as key, before 2.4, there were no key parameter.

      "Pylint should use PYTHONPATH in the same way as the Python interpreter. If not, it may be considered as a bug and reported as such. You may want to try pylint --init-hook 'import sys;print(sys.path)' to run pylint while displaying its Python path at first.\n",

      "Given your file/folder structure: ├── Functions │ └── functions.py ├── <main app folder> │ └── app.py Although your imports may run correctly once you've added path/to/Functions to sys.path, Pylint is giving you that warning because that is not the recommended way of declaring imports, especially when you're importing modules outside the app package/folder. From the PEP8 Style Guide for Imports (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports): Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as when a directory inside a package ends up on sys.path): import mypkg.sibling from mypkg import sibling from mypkg.sibling import example The recommended solution is to setup Functions as a package (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) by adding a __init__.py file under it: ├── parent │ └── Functions │ ├── __init__.py │ └── functions.py then importing your functions like one of these: sys.path.append(\"/path/to/parent\") # option 1 from Functions import functions functions.copy() functions.delete() # option2 from Functions.functions import copy, delete copy() delete() Both options should run correctly and satisfy PyLint. Now, if you really want to do a non-absolute import like from functions import func, and get PyLint to accept that, I recommend renaming functions.py to something else. This is because, on some case-insensitive systems, importing Functions and functions could get treated as the same module. When you tell PyLint to look into /path/to/Functions (I'll show later), it might not be able to differentiate if copy and delete is part of Functions or of functions, and it might still show an import-error. So, what you need to do is rename functions.py (ex. filefuncs.py): ├── Functions │ └── filefuncs.py ├── <main app folder> │ └── app.py Then in you VS Code workspace, add this to your .vscode/settings.json file to tell PyLint where to look for the filefuncs module: \"python.linting.pylintArgs\": [ \"--init-hook\", \"import sys; sys.path.append('/path/to/Functions')\" ] Then you can now import it same as your original code but without PyLint errors: sys.path.append(\"/path/to/Functions\") from filefuncs import copy, delete copy() delete() The second way will get you what you need, but it contains some workarounds for PyLint to work.

      "\n",
      "1. **CSS Sticky Positioning**: This method uses the `position: sticky;` property along with the `top` property to define the sticky position. Once the element reaches the specified position, it becomes fixed and stays at the top of the viewport.\n",

Column and table name parameters could be checked against a list of valid values either statically defined or dynamically based on you database structure. You could do some basic regex checking on the where parameter, but that will only really help against obvious SQL injection. With the flexiblity you intend to offer in the form of SELECT FROM WHERE you could have queries like this: SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE id = 1 AND 'username' in (SELECT username FROM users) You could look at something like JOOQ to offer safe dynamic query building while still being able to constrain the things your users are allowed to query for. Constraining your users in one way or another is key here. Not doing that means you have to worry not just about SQL injection, but also about performance issues for instance. Provide them with a visual (drag-and-drop) query builder for instance.\n",

      "Your problem is that you inserted the user name directly into the string, where it is read as an SQL expression. In theory, you could wrap the string into quotes ('), but this would still create problems if the string contains quotes or other special characters.

Or if you know there will be only one match, or you only want one match even if there's more than one, you can add a mystate.setMaxRows(1); ...before executeQuery(), and then just use if/else, no need for the flag: if (rs.next()) { System.out.println(\"Your Name is \" + rs.getString(\"name\")); } else { System.out.println(\"...\"); } Obligatory SQL-injection link: http://bobby-tables.com/ (http://bobby-tables.com/) And cartoon: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/EGJMi.png)\n",

Essentially the query would become this: String sqlQuery = \"select st from master where st_id= ? \"; Then you'd use the tooling in the language to add the parameter value to the query: preparedStatement = conn.prepareStatement(sqlQuery); preparedStatement.setInt(1, id); // <--- here rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery(); Side note: Some may point out that if id is a non-string type then this code would still be safe from SQL injections, because nobody could inject anything dangerous as a number for example. While that may be circumstantially true for any given instance of this, it's not guaranteed and still not safe practice. Always treat user input as values, not as code.

Side notes: When the value is not present, an exception should be raised, instead of a string returned. The return value of a string when the value is not found is a bad choice, in my opinion, since there is still a single value returned, and it appeared the function ran successfully. But when later on, that value is used as an index into an array, there'll be an exception that has its roots in this function, but the exception won't show that. in Python, you would just do arr.index(key), which replaces this whole function (and may be more optimised). Arguably, what you have here, is a C-style function, which happens to be coded in Python, but really shouldn't be used in Python.

To fix this, you could define x and y list outside the loop and append in the for loop, or more simply, just use numpy.loadtxt(): import numpy as np data = np.loadtxt('demo.txt',comments='<',usecols=[0,2]) Here, I have specified to skip rows beginning with a less than sign, so we only get the actual data. Second, for numpy.interp to actually work, you need the x-coordinate to be an increasing sequence (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html). (check the notes). For your data, x is a decreasing sequence, so you should flip the data after loading it: x = data[::-1,0] y = data[::-1,1] interpolation = np.interp(grid,x,y) Alternatively, you could just use the scipy.interpolate package on the original, unflipped data. This has the added advantage of allowing you to extrapolate data that isn't enclosed by your input domain: from scipy import interpolate interpolation = interpolate.interp1d(x,y,fill_value='extrapolate') Note: your input file appears to have more than one <Matrix> </Matrix> set. To get all this to work, I trimmed the file so it only contained one dataset. Otherwise, your x input data will not be strictly increasing, even after flipping, and you will have to sort.\n",

As far as your data goes, you should be able to read the files using np.loadtxt (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html), extract the columns into numpy arrays, and then use interp1d like this: x1, y1 = np.loadtxt('file1.txt').transpose() x2, y2 = np.loadtxt('file2.txt').transpose() # interpolate (x2, y2) onto grid x1 from scipy.interpolate import interp1d func = interp1d(x2, y2, kind='cubic') y2_interp = func(x1)\n",

      "Usually, signals are used for predefined signals called by models (before/after save, delete etc) or Request (request started/finished). Django needs to know where your receiver functions live and register them. That is the reason why you import them in AppConfig.ready(). Otherwise they won't be runned.

This is an example how: # post/apps.py # from django.apps import AppConfig class PostConfig(AppConfig): name = 'post' def ready(self): print(\">DEBUG::loading_signals\") import post.signals # other stuff you need imported on app's startup If you're still not receiving signals, try specifying your app's default config class inside your app's __init__.py file, like so: # post/__init__.py # default_app_config = \"post.apps.PostConfig\" from Django docs (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/signals/#connecting-receiver-functions) itself: Where should this code [signals] live?

Not sure what your actual error is because you are not displaying it (if this is a dev environment set DEBUG = True to get a better stack trace) But by lookingat you code, you are not grabbing the arguments correctly in the signal handler. It should look more like this: def login_handler(sender, **kwargs): try: user = kwargs['user'] request = kwargs['request'] result=Visitor.objects.get(user=user) print \"You already have login with your name\" except: visitor=Visitor() visitor.user=user visitor.save() post_login.connect(login_handler)\n",

If you’re using the receiver() decorator, import the signals submodule inside ready(). yourapp/apps.py: class YourAppConfig(AppConfig): name = \"yourapp\" def ready(self): from . import signals That should be enough to get the signals registered at the correct time. Regarding two issues: Existing user models in your database won't get updated, only new ones. Either drop your db and create new users or add a data migration (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/#data-migrations) if your database is live or you want to keep the current. Models connected by signals must be created without having any data for them. So you either must have nullable fields (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#null) or fields with defaults (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#default). Two forms So you've posted 2 forms as one form in the HTML, this works because your forms don't share field names (except primary key, which isn't posted). For future reference, you can use a form prefix (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/forms/api/#prefixes-for-forms) to deal with duplicate field names and even use the same form for different purposes (shipping and billing address for example). On signals Signals are used when an event happens (user is saved, user logs in), that is part of 3rd party code (in this case Django). But when you're the one creating the event, they are not needed as you can just do whatever you want right at where you create the event. Logged in or not The correct test is: if not request.user.is_authenticated: On to the solution When saving related models with one or more forms, you should first create the models that can be saved without the other model of the relationship existing. These are: The model a foreign key points to (Shipping). The model of a OneToOneField, where the OneToOneField is not defined (User) Due to the signal, our profile model will be created with empty values, but the form does not know that the mobile_number belongs on the Profile model, because it is a ModelForm bound to the User Model. It treats mobile_number as a field that you will handle yourself. So let's do that: user = form.save() # save returns the model instance created profile = user.profile profile.mobile_number = form.cleaned_data['mobile_number'] As said, we can create the address without problems and then we can link it to the profile: address = form1.save() # save returns the model instance created profile.address = address And now we can save the profile: profile.save() So putting it all together: def register(request): if not request.user.is_authenticated: # The correct way to test for logged in user if request.method == \"POST\": form = UserRegisterForm(request.POST) form1 = AddressRegisterForm(request.POST) if form.is_valid() and form1.is_valid(): email = form.cleaned_data.get(\"email\") if not User.objects.filter(email=email).exists(): username = form.cleaned_data.get(\"username\") messages.success( request, f\"The Account created for {username}! You are now able to login.\", ) user = form.save() profile = user.profile profile.mobile_number = form.cleaned_data['mobile_number'] address = form1.save() profile.address = address profile.save() return redirect(\"login\") else: messages.warning( request, f\"The email is either invalid or already used to create an account\", ) else: form1 = AddressRegisterForm() form = UserRegisterForm() return render(request, \"register.html\", {\"form\": form, \"form1\": form1}) else: username = request.user.username messages.warning(request, f\"You are already logged in as {username}!\") return redirect(\"home\")\n",

Strictly speaking, signal handling and registration code can live anywhere you like, although it’s recommended to avoid the application’s root module and its models module to minimize side-effects of importing code. In practice, signal handlers are usually defined in a signals submodule of the application they relate to. Signal receivers are connected in the ready() method of your application configuration class. If you’re using the receiver() decorator, import the signals submodule inside ready().\n",

      "The simplest way to accomplish this is to pass functions from the component that contains all of these components to update their state values on parent. Then pass a function to do something with the values of the checkboxes, also on the parent. Here's an example, let me know if you need clarification: class CustomOne extends React.Component { render() { return ( <label> field 1: <input name={this.props.inputName} type=\"text\" value={this.props.inputValue} onChange={this.props.handleInputChange} /> </label> ); } } class CustomTwo extends React.Component { render() { return ( <label> field 2: <input name={this.props.inputName} type=\"text\" value={this.props.inputValue} onChange={this.props.handleInputChange} /> </label> ); } } class CustomThree extends React.Component { render() { return ( <label> field 3: <input name={this.props.inputName} type=\"text\" value={this.props.inputValue} onChange={this.props.handleInputChange} /> </label> ); } } class App extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { inputValue1: \"\", inputValue2: \"\", inputValue3: \"\" }; this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this); this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); } handleInputChange(event) { const value = event.target.value; const name = event.target.name; this.setState({ [name]: value }); } handleClick() { console.log(this.state.inputValue1); console.log(this.state.inputValue2); console.log(this.state.inputValue3); } render() { return ( <div> <form> <CustomOne inputName=\"inputValue1\" inputValue={this.state.inputValue1} handleInputChange={this.handleInputChange} /> <br /> <CustomTwo inputName=\"inputValue2\" inputValue={this.state.inputValue2} handleInputChange={this.handleInputChange} /> <br /> <CustomThree inputName=\"inputValue3\" inputValue={this.state.inputValue3} handleInputChange={this.handleInputChange} /> </form> <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Submit</button> </div> ); } } const rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\"); ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.6.3/umd/react.production.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.6.3/umd/react-dom.production.min.js\"></script> <div id=\"root\"></div> EDIT I have updated my answer to make each a text input field AND to put them in their own custom components. It is exactly the same concept, you just have to pass the update functions to the input fields, as well as the values. All stored in the parent. To do this a different way, you would need to use something for state management such as React's Context API: https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html (https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled Components If you want React to manage the state of your inputs you want to use controlled components (https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). With this pattern, React becomes the 'single source of truth' for the state of the input. A simple controlled checkbox would look like this: function ControlledCheckbox() { const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(false); function handleChange() { setChecked(!checked) } return <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={checked} onChange={handleChange} /> } Using checkboxes with filtering In the current case where you are filtering data using checkboxes, the checked attribute can be set as a boolean which is true/false depending on whether the particular filter criterion represented by that checkbox is included in the user's chosen filter criteria. const criteriaChoices = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] function App() { const [criteria, setCriteria] = React.useState(['foo']); const handleChange(e) { const checkboxId = e.target.id setCriteria(criteria.includes(checkboxId) ? criteria.filter(c => c !== checkboxId) : [...criteria, checkboxId] ) }; return criteriaChoices.map(choice => ( <label key={choice} for={choice}> <input id={choice} type=\"checkbox\" checked={criteria.includes(choice)} onChange={handleChange} /> {choice} </label> )) In the above, the first checkbox rendered will be ticked because the criteria in state includes 'foo'. The other two will be unticked to start with because 'bar' and 'baz' are not in the criteria in state. The handleChange function adds/removes the clicked filter criterion depending on whether or not it is already in criteria. Note you don't need to check e.target.checked because React is in full control of the state on which the checkbox's checked attribute depends. Resetting Once your components are controlled, you can reset the checkboxes easily by resetting the state on which the checked attribute depends. So in the above code, calling setCriteria([]) in a handleReset function would mean that criteria.includes(choice) is always false and therefore every checkbox would remain unchecked. With Material-UI I took the liberty of distilling the essential elements of the issue from your code and put together a small example using Mui components on CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/reverent-lamarr-gserz?file=/src/App.js).\n",
      "\n",
      "You need an array to store all the checked status. handleCheck = id => () => { // Get indentify from each element const { checkedList } = this.state; const result = checkedList.includes(id) // Check if checked at this moment ? checkedList.filter(x => x !== id) // If checked, remove : [...checkedList, id]; // If not, add this.setState({ checkedList: result }, () => { // setState console.log(this.state.checkedList); // setState is async, log in callback }); }; And if you want, you can make the Checkbox component a common one so you don't need to bind the label in three places in each of it. <Checkbox label=\"Cake\" onChange={this.handleCheck(\"Cake\")} checked={checkedList.includes(\"Cake\")} // If included, checked /> Another minimum reproducible demo Try it in-text: const list = [...Array(10).keys()].map(x => ({ id: x })); const App = () => { const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState([]); const onChangeHandler = id => () => { selected.includes(id) ? setSelected(selected.filter(x => x !== id)) : setSelected([...selected, id]); }; const onRemove = () => { setSelected([]); }; return ( <div className=\"App\"> {list.map(item => ( <input type=\"checkbox\" key={item.id} checked={selected.includes(item.id)} onChange={onChangeHandler(item.id)} /> ))} <br /> <button onClick={onRemove}>Remove all</button> <div>{selected.join(\",\")}</div> </div> ); } ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root\")); <div id=\"root\"></div> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.12.0/umd/react.production.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.12.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js\"></script>\n",

      "You would use this.setState({}) inside the event handler to update the state of a component in React. This triggers a rerender in React which allows you to query the the updated state (this.state.selected). Be advised that this.setState() expects an immutable object, so you should never change the previous, but always set a new state object! Answer to comment: For selectItem: onSelectChange = event => this.setState({selected:event.target.value}) and for checkboxes (note the prevState): onCheckboxChange = item => event => this.setState(({selected,...prevState})=> ({ ...prevState, selected: event.target.checked? selected.concat(item): selected.filter(it=> it!== item) })) and usage: {this.state.items.map((item, i) => <input type=\"checkbox\" key={i} checked={this.state.selected.indexOf(item.Key) >= 0} onChange={onCheckboxChange(item)} /> )} This has the downside that it will create a new function on each rerender, so it's better to create a custom CheckboxItem and pass the item to it and use a handleClick.\n",

      "I am not quite sure what is the exact question, but I would like to provide you my answer. Since each checkbox has an individual state of being checked or unchecked, one state field does not solve your issue, cause using one state field for all of them defines their checked/unchecked state together. This is why you had the problem of them being checked/unchecked at the same time. The approach to solve this would be to create individual state fields for each checkbox, but obviously that is not the smartest solution. Therefore, I would recommend you to create a separate checkbox function, which has a state field inside of it, making it individual for the checkbox itself. In my code provided below, there is an ESLint error, which would be solved if you created a separate file and moved the function there. Additionally, if you wanted to add or remove items from the selectedAnswers array, you could do so in the onChange function. Hope, this answers your question. import React, { useState } from \"react\"; import \"./styles.css\"; const answersArray = [\"answer1\", \"answer2\", \"answer3\", \"answer4\"]; const selectedAnswers = []; export default function App() { const checkboxComponent = (index, possibleAnswer) => { const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false); return ( <> <div> <input name={[index, possibleAnswer]} type=\"checkbox\" onChange={() => setChecked(!checked)} checked={checked} /> </div> <div> <span>{possibleAnswer}</span> </div> </> ); }; return ( <div className=\"App\"> <h1>question 1 - how to manipulate the checkboxes</h1> {answersArray.map((possibleAnswer, index) => ( <li key={[index, possibleAnswer]}> {checkboxComponent(index, possibleAnswer)} </li> ))} </div> ); }\n",

      "Your CheckBox-component does not contain a key property. This is helpful for React to identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Source: https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html (https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) I also do not understand why you have two states, checkboxState and checkedCheckboxes. Is there another reason for this? I think this would be easier with a single state which holds the indexes (or values) of the checked checkboxes. [update after comments] The code below is the desired solution by OP to have the selected object values in a React state. const { useState } = React; const Checkboxes = () => { // With this useState I wan't to collect the checked checkboxes const [checkedCheckboxes, setCheckedCheckboxes] = useState([]); // This is my handler method that gets triggered when a checkbox get's checked/unchecked // ..and toggles the state of the checkbox const handleCheckboxChange = (data) => { const isChecked = checkedCheckboxes.some(checkedCheckbox => checkedCheckbox.value === data.value) if (isChecked) { setCheckedCheckboxes( checkedCheckboxes.filter( (checkedCheckbox) => checkedCheckbox.value !== data.value ) ); } else { setCheckedCheckboxes(checkedCheckboxes.concat(data)); } }; const receivedData = [{ value: \"A\" }, { value: \"B\" }, { value: \"C\" }]; return ( <> <div className=\"checkboxes\"> <h1>Checkboxes:</h1> {receivedData?.map((data, index) => ( <input key={`cb-${index}`} value={data.value} type=\"checkbox\" checked={checkedCheckboxes.some(checkedCheckbox => checkedCheckbox.value === data.value)} onChange={() => handleCheckboxChange(data)} /> ))} </div> <div> <h1>State:</h1> <pre>{JSON.stringify(checkedCheckboxes, null, 2)}</pre> </div> </> ); }; ReactDOM.render(<Checkboxes />, document.getElementById(\"app\"));\n",

      "\n",
      "You can manage all state from the parent component while giving each child component a referance to setState (or a function that use setState inside). You can send checked of each object in the list to each corresponding child component as a prop. This way, as the state is kept in the parent component, each state change reflects on the UI. Sample component: import { useState } from 'react' const DEFAULT_ITEMS = [ { id: \"id_akdjk\", label: \"quora\", checked: false }, { id: \"id_xlhwi\", label: \"library\", checked: false }, { id: \"id_xoqix\", label: \"reddit\", checked: true } ] const ListItem = ({ label, checked, change }) => { return( <div> <input type=\"checkbox\" onChange={change} checked={checked}/> <label htmlFor=\"vehicle1\">{label}</label><br/> </div> ) } export default function Component() { const [items, setItems] = useState(DEFAULT_ITEMS) const handleInputChange = (index) => { // manipulate copy of state. (not state itself) const copyState = [...items] // updating that specific indice copyState.splice(index, 1, {...items[index], checked: !items[index][\"checked\"]}) setItems(copyState) } return ( <div> { items.map((el, i) => { return <ListItem key={i} label={el.label} checked={el.checked} change={() => handleInputChange(i)}/> })} <div> <p>You chose:</p> { items.map((el) => el.checked ? el.label : '').join(' ') } </div> </div> ) } So your onPress would be: // assuming you are using this data as the state const DEFAULT_ITEMS = [ { id: \"id_akdjk\", checked: false }, { id: \"id_xlhwi\", checked: false }, { id: \"id_xoqix\", checked: false } ] ... const [items, setItems] = useState(DEFAULT_ITEMS) const handleInputChange = (index) => { // manipulate copy of state. (not state itself) const copyState = [...items] // updating that specific indice copyState.splice(index, 1, {...items[index], checked: !items[index][\"checked\"]}) setItems(copyState) } //... onPress={() => handleInputChange(i)} P.S. using index to update state is not a good idea.

      "The ideal improvement I am looking for is not to wait few seconds, but for a certain event to happen => New data is added. Is this possible ? Best solution : data pushing : The application that produces the content should inform the other application as it may read the content. You could use any channel that may convey the information between two distinct applications. For example by using a specific file that the writer updates to notify new things to read. The writer could write/overwrite in this file a update date and the reader would read the data file only if it doesn't read any content since this date. A more robust way but with more overhead could be exposing a notification service from the reader side. Why not a REST service. In this way, the writer could notify the reader via the service as new content is ready. Another thing to add, the whole program I am trying to write reads a file in real-time and process its content. So this means that thread.sleep or the timer will pause my whole program. A workaround solution : data pulling performed by a specific thread : You have probably a multi-core CPU. So create a separate thread to read the produced file to allow other threads of your application to be runnable. Besides, you also could performs some regular pause : Thread.sleep() to optimize the core use done by the reading thread. It could look like : Thread readingThread = new Thread(new MyReadingProcessing()); readingThread.start(); Where MyReadingProcessing is a Runnable : public class MyReadingProcessing implements Runnable{ public void run(){ while (true){ readFile(...); try{ Thread.sleep(1000); // 1 second here but choose the deemed reasonable time according the metrics of your producer application } catch(InterruptedException e){ Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } if (isAllReadFile()){ // condition to stop the reading process return; } } } }\n",

      "To achieve non-blocking file modification monitoring on a BlackBerry device, consider implementing a combination of the following strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Pushing**: Implement a notification system where the data producer (application generating the content) informs the consumer (application processing the content) about new data availability. This can be achieved through various channels, such as a dedicated file or a RESTful service.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Dedicated File**: The producer can write a timestamp or a unique identifier to a specific file indicating new data is available. The consumer then reads this file first and processes the actual data file if its content hasn't changed since the recorded timestamp.\n",
      "   - **RESTful Service**: The producer exposes a RESTful service to notify the consumer whenever new data is ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Separate Reading Thread**: To avoid pausing your entire application, create a separate thread dedicated to reading the data file. This allows other threads to remain functional during the reading operation. You can also include periodic sleep intervals within the reading thread to optimize resource usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **WatchService (Java 7+)**: Utilize Java's built-in WatchService API, which efficiently monitors file system changes by leveraging native file event notification facilities. If your target environment does not support these features, WatchService gracefully falls back to polling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Apache Commons IO**: If you cannot upgrade to Java 7, consider using Apache Commons IO's `FileAlterationObserver` and `FileAlterationMonitor`. These classes allow you to observe file system changes and execute listener operations upon detecting create, change, or delete events.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **JNotify (Java 6+)** : For Java 6 and earlier versions, use JNotify, a Java library enabling applications to listen to file system events such as creation, modification, renaming, and deletion.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Exclusive Locking**: Acquire an exclusive lock on the unwritten data area. Release the lock once the writing process completes. This approach ensures compatibility with other applications running concurrently but necessitates a smart reader capable of retrying failed reads or combining it with another strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Special Marker in File**: Within the file itself, write a special marker to indicate completed writes. Force the buffer to ensure data consistency and make the marker visible to other processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining these techniques, you can achieve a robust and efficient solution for monitoring file modifications without blocking your application or relying on polling mechanisms.\n",

Be careful, however, of defining variables in code like this: if x == True: a = 1 else: print \"Not true\" If you have code like this, and x ends up being False, then a will not be defined.

Since x is declared inside the inner scope, Python will infer and use the x in this scope even if it is declared after usage. Note that Python cannot distinguish modification from declaration; what was meant to modify x from the global scope was interpreted to declare another variable x within that scope. (https://i.stack.imgur.com/tLQVj.png) No variables declared inside the inner scope If no variables are declared within the inner scope, Python will switch the inferred scope to nonlocal, and then to global.

Therefore, you need extra caution when dealing with scopes. Because Python cannot distinguish variable declaration from variable modification, my advice is that if you want to use a global variable, you should explicitly state it beforehand. This also applies to nested scopes. x = 5 def outer(): x = 7 def inner(): nonlocal x print(x) x = 3 print(x) inner() Running the outer function gives the following result. >>> outer() 7 3 Try changing the nonlocal keyword to global and see a different result; or remove the line completely to get an error.\n",

      "Challenges in generating truncated normal random variables\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So you want to sample N 2-dimensional points from a truncated normal distribution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution)? Gladly, scipy comes with that one built-in (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.truncnorm.html#scipy.stats.truncnorm). This generates a N*2 numpy array points with random points: from scipy.stats import truncnorm import numpy as np N = 1000 L = 5.0 mu = 4.0 sigma = 0.8 lower, upper = 0, L X = truncnorm( (lower - mu) / sigma, (upper - mu) / sigma, loc=mu, scale=sigma) points = np.reshape(X.rvs(2*N), (N, 2)) The code was adapted from this answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/18444710/1071311).\n",
      "\n",
      "You say you want to learn the basic idea of sampling a truncated distribution, but your source is a blog post about Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm)? Do you actually need this \"method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult\"? Taking this as your starting point is like learning English by reading Shakespeare. Truncated normal For truncated normal, basic rejection sampling is all you need: generate samples for original distribution, reject those outside of bounds. As Leandro Caniglia noted, you should not expect truncated distribution to have the same PDF except on a shorter interval — this is plain impossible because the area under the graph of a PDF is always 1. If you cut off stuff from sides, there has to be more in the middle; the PDF gets rescaled. It's quite inefficient to gather samples one by one, when you need 100000. I would grab 100000 normal samples at once, accept only those that fit; then repeat until I have enough. Example of sampling truncated normal between amin and amax: import numpy as np n_samples = 100000 amin, amax = -1, 2 samples = np.zeros((0,)) # empty for now while samples.shape[0] < n_samples: s = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(n_samples,)) accepted = s[(s >= amin) & (s <= amax)] samples = np.concatenate((samples, accepted), axis=0) samples = samples[:n_samples] # we probably got more than needed, so discard extra ones And here is the comparison with the PDF curve, rescaled by division by cdf(amax) - cdf(amin) as explained above. from scipy.stats import norm _ = plt.hist(samples, bins=50, density=True) t = np.linspace(-2, 3, 500) plt.plot(t, norm.pdf(t)/(norm.cdf(amax) - norm.cdf(amin)), 'r') plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/djBzh.png) Truncated multivariate normal Now we want to keep the first coordinate between amin and amax, and the second between bmin and bmax. Same story, except there will be a 2-column array and the comparison with bounds is done in a relatively sneaky way: (np.min(s - [amin, bmin], axis=1) >= 0) & (np.max(s - [amax, bmax], axis=1) <= 0) This means: subtract amin, bmin from each row and keep only the rows where both results are nonnegative (meaning we had a >= amin and b >= bmin). Also do a similar thing with amax, bmax. Accept only the rows that meet both criteria. n_samples = 10 amin, amax = -1, 2 bmin, bmax = 0.2, 2.4 mean = [0.3, 0.5] cov = [[2, 1.1], [1.1, 2]] samples = np.zeros((0, 2)) # 2 columns now while samples.shape[0] < n_samples: s = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=(n_samples,)) accepted = s[(np.min(s - [amin, bmin], axis=1) >= 0) & (np.max(s - [amax, bmax], axis=1) <= 0)] samples = np.concatenate((samples, accepted), axis=0) samples = samples[:n_samples, :] Not going to plot, but here are some values: naturally, within bounds. array([[ 0.43150033, 1.55775629], [ 0.62339265, 1.63506963], [-0.6723598 , 1.58053835], [-0.53347361, 0.53513105], [ 1.70524439, 2.08226558], [ 0.37474842, 0.2512812 ], [-0.40986396, 0.58783193], [ 0.65967087, 0.59755193], [ 0.33383214, 2.37651975], [ 1.7513789 , 1.24469918]])\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning the value of the bounds for samples outside them, will result in too many samples falling on the bounds. This is not representative of the actual distribution. The values on the bounds need to be rejected and replaced by a new sample. Such code could be: def test_truncnorm(loc, scale, bounds): while True: s = np.random.normal(loc, scale) if bounds[0] <= s <= bounds[1]: break return s This can be extremely slow given narrow bounds. Scipy's truncnorm (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.truncnorm.html) handles such cases more efficiently. A bit surprisingly, the bounds are expressed in function of the standard normal, so your call would be: s = scipy.stats.truncnorm.rvs((bounds[0]-loc)/scale, (bounds[1]-loc)/scale, loc=loc, scale=scale) Note that scipy works much faster when making use of numpy's vectorization and broadcasting (https://unidata.github.io/python-training/workshop/NumPy/numpy-broadcasting-and-vectorization/). And once you're used to the notation, it also looks simpler to write and read. All samples can be calculated in one go as: X = np.array(X) D = np.array(D) bounds = np.array(bounds) samples = scipy.stats.truncnorm.rvs((bounds[:, 0] - X) / D, (bounds[:, 1] - X) / D, loc=X, scale=D)\n",

Many people seem to have troubles understanding that data can't just be arbitrarily passed to a view. HTTP is a stateless protocol: each request exists on it's own, as if user had never been to any other page of the site. The concept of a session was created to provide a sense of \"state\" to a cohesive unit such as a site. With sessions, data is stored in some form of persistent storage and a \"key\" to look up that data is given to the client (typically the user's browser). On the next page load, the client sends the key back to the server, and the server uses it to look up the data to give the appearance of state. As a result, if you need data from one view available in another, you need to add it to the session, do your redirect, and look up the data in the session from the next view.\n",

      "The HTTPFound exception, which performs a page redirection, might not perform the expected redirection due to several reasons. Here are some possible causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Browser caching**: HTTP permanent redirects (status code 301) are typically cached by browsers. If a user has previously visited a page with a 301 redirect, the browser may serve the cached version instead of making a new request to the server. To prevent this, you can use cache control headers or add random query parameters to the URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Session expiration**: If the user's session has expired, the redirection might fail. Ensure that the session is properly managed and validated before attempting the redirection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Invalid URL generation**: Make sure that the URL generated by `RedirectToAction` or similar methods is valid and correctly points to the target page. Incorrect URLs or typos can cause the redirection to fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Middleware interference**: Middleware components in your application might interfere with the redirection process. Check if there are any middleware components that could potentially block or modify the response.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Exception handling**: If the redirection is wrapped within an `except` clause, ensure that the exception being caught is indeed related to the redirection issue. Catching a broader exception might mask the actual problem. Consider making the exception handling more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **AJAX requests**: If the redirection is initiated from an AJAX request, using `RedirectToAction` might not work as expected. In such cases, consider returning a JSON response or using `JavaScriptResult`.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Session management**: If the redirection relies on session data, ensure that the session data is correctly populated and accessible during the redirection process. Any issues with session management can lead to failed redirections.\n",

      "8. **URL rewriting rules**: If URL rewriting rules are in place, they might interfere with the redirection process. Review your URL rewriting configuration to ensure it doesn't conflict with the intended redirection.\n",

      "Recursion must have a base case - the condition upon meeting which the function stops. You are going down from num to num-1 and so on until 0, at which point the function meets the base case: num == 0 and returns 1. From this point the recursion unwinds back, and multiplies 1*num-(num-1)...num. Also, factorial is defined for non-negative integers only, so not much point in returning -1. Another thing: the base case should really be num == 1. What you are doing is multiplying by 1 when num ==1 and then multiplying by 1 again, when num == 0. Which returns wrong factorial for factorial(0). Edit: factorial(0) is 1. So, you were indeed correct to return 1, but I would still put it as a corner case. No need to wait that extra step to get to 0. function factorial(n){ // Handle the corner cases: you might as well just throw an error if (n < 0) return undefined; if (n == 0) return 1; // Base case if (n == 1) return 1; // Iterative step // (If the function got to this point, it means, that n > 1) return n * factorial(n - 1); // In order to return the expression on the right side of \"return\", // You need to calculate the `factorial(n - 1)` // When you try calculating it, you will see, that now you need to // find out the `factorial(n - 1)` again, but this time the // `n` is actually `(n - 1)` :) // So this way, you are digging into the call stack. // At some point you reach the 1.

      "\n",
      "I don't really like recursion for factorial algorithms. while loops work nicely. With factorial the main case is that we are still running equations while n is greater than 0 so 1 is the last number we are going to multiply. This is because we know that once our iteration is 1 we want to stop the algorithm and the last number will remain the factorial. function factorial(n){ var product = 1 while(n > 0){ product = product * n n = n -1 } return product } if you are going to do recursion you need to have a base case you need to think of what factorial is the easiest to solve. So factorial(2) is the smallest factorial number. If the factorial is 1 we do not want to do another subtraction because anything times 0 is 0. The final equation or the base case will be n * 1. So that would be the base case for a recursive algorithm. function factorial(n){ if (n == 1){ return n }else{ return n * factorial(n -1) } } recursion and loops work under similar principles in a loop what is contained between the {} in JS is the code which is run under a certain condition. With recursion we are calling the code as a self contained module in a function. We are manipulating the parameters with the conditions of the functions to create a case where the function will stop. Otherwise we will end up in an infinite loop.\n",

But in my opinion that would obscure the purpose of the function (which is to implement the traditional definition of factorial).

The return value of FirstFactorial(num-1) which is (num-1)! is multiplied with the value of num to get num!. This value (num!) is then returned by the function FirstFactorial() when passed with parameter num or FirstFactorial(num) Now on calling FirstFactorial(num-1) inside the FirstFactorial(num), FirstFactorial function will again be executed checking the first if condition. If it fails, it will return the value of (n-1)*FirstFactorial(num-1 - 1). This will recurse until first if condition is satisfied and value is returned without calling the FirstFactorial again.

      "I think you have to understand the logic of factorial. So factorial is just products, indicated by an exclamation mark ie, if you write 0! = 1 1! = 1 2! = 2*1 3! = 3*2*1 4! = 4*3*2*1 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 Hope you find the pattern, so you can write the above factorials as: 0! = 1 1! = 1 2! = 2*1! 3! = 3*2! 4! = 4*3! 5! = 5*4! So in your function you are using the similar logic. Now in your function if(number == 0 || number == 1) { return 1; } The above logic is to cover the first two cases i.e, 0! and 1! And return number * Factorial(number -1); is for the rest of the numbers. So you are using the recursive technique of solving the factorial problem. To understand recursion, lets take a number say 5 i.e., we want find the value of 5!. Then first your function will check if(number == 0 || number == 1) which is not satisfied, then it moves to the next line ie, return number * Factorial(number -1); which gives 5*Factorial(5-1) which is equal to 5*Factorial(4) Now on subsequent calls to your Factorial function it will return the value like below: 5*(4*Factorial(4-1)) which is equal to 5*(4*Factorial(3)) 5*(4*(3*Factorial(3-1)) which is equal to 5*(4*(3*Factorial(2))) 5*(4*(3*(2*Factorial(2-1)))) which is equal to 5*(4*(3*(2*Factorial(1)))) Now when it returns factorial(1) then your condition if(number == 0 || number == 1) is satisfied and hence you get the result as: 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 On a side note: Beware that factrial is used only for positive integers.\n",

It is based on the C3 superclass linearisation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) algorithm. This is called a linearisation, because the tree structure is broken down into a linear order. The mro method can be used to create this list: >>> from super_init import A,B,C,D` >>> D.mro() [<class 'super_init.D'>, <class 'super_init.B'>, <class 'super_init.C'>, <class 'super_init.A'>, <class 'object'>]` Pay attention to the MRO where it goes from D > B > C > A. Where you believe super() to be simply calling the parent class of the current scope - it is not. It is looking through your object's class MRO (i.e. D.mro()) with current class (i.e. B, C...) to determine which is the next class in line to resolve the method. The super() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) actually uses two arguments, but when called with zero arguments inside a class, it's implicitly passed: Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, super() is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods. To be precise, at the point of B.m(), the super() call actually translates to: super(B, x).m() # because the self being passed at the time is instance of D, which is x That call resolves within the D.mro() from the B class onward, which actually is C, not A as you imagined. Therefore, C.m() is called first, and within it, the super(C, x).m() resolves to A.m() and that is called. After that, it resolves back to after the super() within C.m(), back up to after the super() within B.m(), and back up to D.m(). This is easily observed when you add a few more lines: class A: def m(self): print(\"m of A called\") class B(A): def m(self): print(\"m of B called\") print(super()) super().m() # resolves to C.m print('B.m is complete') class C(A): def m(self): print(\"m of C called\") print(super()) super().m() # resolves to A.m print('C.m is complete') class D(B,C): def m(self): print(\"m of D called\") print(super()) super().m() # resolves to B.m print('D.m is complete') if (__name__ == '__main__'): x = D() x.m() print(D.mro()) Which results in: m of D called <super: <class 'D'>, <D object>> m of B called <super: <class 'B'>, <D object>> m of C called <super: <class 'C'>, <D object>> m of A called C.m is complete # <-- notice how C.m is completed before B.m B.m is complete D.m is complete [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>] So in actuality, nothing is ever called twice or skipped. You just misinterpreted the idea of the MRO resolving from the call based on the scope where super() is, as opposed to the call from the initial object. Here's another fun little example to demonstrate the MRO in more details: def print_cur_mro(cls, obj): # helper function to show current MRO print(f\"Current MRO: {' > '.join([f'*{m.__name__}*' if m.__name__ == cls.__name__ else m.__name__ for m in type(obj).mro()])}\") class X: def m(self): print('m of X called') print_cur_mro(X, self) try: super().a_only() # Resolves to A.a_only if called from D(), even though A is not in X inheritance except AttributeError as exc: # Resolves to AttributeError if not called from D() print(type(exc), exc) print('X.m is complete') class A: def m(self): print(\"m of A called\") print_cur_mro(A, self) def a_only(self): print('a_only called') class B(X): def m(self): print(\"m of B called\") print_cur_mro(B, self) super().m() # Resolves to X.m print('B.m is complete') def b_only(self): print('b_only called') class C(A): def m(self): print(\"m of C called\") print_cur_mro(C, self) try: super().b_only() # Resolves to AttributeError if called, since A.b_only doesn't exist if from D() except AttributeError as exc: print(type(exc), exc) super().m() # Resolves to A.m print('C.m is complete') def c_only(self): print('c_only called, calling m of C') C.m(self) class D(B,C): def m(self): print(\"m of D called\") print_cur_mro(D, self) super().c_only() # Resolves to C.c_only, since c_only doesn't exist in B or X. super().m() # Resolves to B.m print('D.m is complete') if (__name__ == '__main__'): x = D() x.m() print(D.mro()) x2 = X() x2.m() print(X.mro()) Result: # x.m() call: m of D called Current MRO: *D* > B > X > C > A > object c_only called, calling m of C m of C called Current MRO: D > B > X > *C* > A > object <class 'AttributeError'> 'super' object has no attribute 'b_only' m of A called Current MRO: D > B > X > C > *A* > object C.m is complete m of B called Current MRO: D > *B* > X > C > A > object m of X called Current MRO: D > B > *X* > C > A > object a_only called X.m is complete B.m is complete D.m is complete # D.mro() call: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.X'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>] # x2.m() call: m of X called Current MRO: *X* > object <class 'AttributeError'> 'super' object has no attribute 'a_only' X.m is complete # X.mro() call: [<class '__main__.X'>, <class 'object'>]\n",

The search starts from the class right after the type. So to use it correctly, you should use super() to refer to Something, and super(Something, self) to refer to SomethingElse; you can see the order by reading the __mro__ property of the Both class: class Something(): pass class SomethingElse(): pass class Both(Something, SomethingElse): pass print(Both.__mro__) Which will tell you the order: (<class '__main__.Both'>, <class '__main__.Something'>, <class '__main__.SomethingElse'>, <class 'object'>) And explain why you're ending up calling object.__init__ with your second call to super(...).__init__(...).\n",

Same story for class B. class C(A,B): def __init__(self): self.c = \"c\" print(self.c) super().__init__() Here we have complicated things up - we have inherited from two classes: A and B. Also calling super().__init__() - which calls A.__init__() and B.__init__() - thus printing in the order you've seen: c, a, b. Second snippet: This where things break. class A(object): def display(self): self.a = \"a\" print(self.a) super().display() This is again, a regular class in Python with the redundant inheritance from the object class - but now we are calling super().display() - which translates to object().display() - and that method does not exist: >>> object().__init__() None >> object.display() AttributeError: type object 'object' has no attribute 'display' TL;DR: Yes, the object class does have __init__(), here it is: def __init__(self): # known special case of object.__init__ \"\"\" Initialize self. See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. \"\"\" pass no, it does not have .display().\n",

      "In python, all classes are implicitly a subclass of object. super will always follow a Method Resolution Order (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/) (mro) to determine which function to call. This is explained well in the super docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super). So, for a class like- class ParentClass: def __init__(self): super(ParentClass, self).__init__() The mro follows - ParentClass -> object Which means super(ParentClass, self) (or the shorthand, super()) translates to object and object.__init__() is indeed a very valid call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inheritance makes me think of a classification hierarchy. And the order of the arguments to super is hierarchical: first the class, then the instance. Another idea, inspired by the answer from ~unutbu: class Fubb(object): def __init__(self, *args, **kw): # Crap, I can't remember how super() goes!? Steps in building up a correct super() call. __init__(self, *args, **kw) # Copy the original method signature. super(Fubb).__init__(self, *args, **kw) # Add super(Type). / ------- / super(Fubb, self).__init__(*args, **kw) # Move 'self', but preserve order.\n",

      "The super() just means \"next in line\", where the line is the mro (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2010692/what-does-mro-do-in-python) ['C', 'A', 'B', 'object']. So next in line for A is B. The mro is calculated according to an algorithm called C3 linearization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization). When you use super(), Python just goes along this order. When you write your class A you don't know yet which class will be next in line. Only after you create your class C with multiple inheritance and run your program you will get the mro and \"know\" what will be next for A. For your example it means: C() calls the __init__() of C, in which it calls the __init__() of A. Now, A uses super() and finds B in the mro, hence it calls the __init__() of B. Next, the __init__() of C calls the __init__() of B again. Calling super() in the __init__() creates a different mro and avoids the double call to the __init__() of B. from __future__ import print_function class A(object): def __init__(self): print(\"A\") super(A, self).__init__() class B(object): def __init__(self): print(\"B\") super(B, self).__init__() class C(A,B): def __init__(self): print(\"C\") super(C, self).__init__() Use: >>> C.mro() [__main__.C, __main__.A, __main__.B, object] >> C() C A B\n",
      "\n",
      "The order of super arguments reflects Python's idea of unbound and bound methods/descriptors. In short, the second argument is optional and thus must come after the required first argument. Built-in Functions: super([type[, object-or-type]]) (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) [...] If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, isinstance(obj, type) must be true. If the second argument is a type, issubclass(type2, type) must be true (this is useful for classmethods). This reflects how a method call self.method() is equivalent to Class.method(self), i.e. the order of operands is Class then self.* Python methods/descriptors come in two flavours: unbound on their defining class, and bound on their instance.* >>> class Base: ... def method(self): print('called Base method') ... >>> Base.method # unbound method <function __main__.Base.method(self)> >>> Base().method # bound method <bound method Base.method of <__main__.Base object at 0x10dd0e910>> >>> Base().method() called Base method A bound descriptor is created by taking an unbound descriptor and binding it to an instance. This is encoded and implemented in the descriptor protocol. >>> instance = Base() >>> unbound = Base.method >>> unbound.__get__(instance) <bound method Base.method of <__main__.Base object at 0x10dd14510>> >>> unbound.__get__(instance)() called Base method The super type is by default unbound. Binding it via the descriptor protocol or by passing an instance is equivalent. >>> class Child(Base): ... >>> instance = Child() >>> super(Child, instance) <super: __main__.Child, <__main__.Child at 0x10dcda9d0>> >>> super(Child).__get__(instance) <super: __main__.Child, <__main__.Child at 0x10dcda9d0>> In either case, the class must be passed first before the instance. From the python-dev archive (https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/6OESFIX27M7TBHPS56RDD6IKJ772JMET/): Add 'super', another new object type with magical properties. super(type) -> unbound super object super(type, obj) -> bound super object; requires isinstance(obj, type) Typical use to call a cooperative superclass method: class C(B): def meth(self, arg): super(C, self).meth(arg); * This description glosses over the finer details of the descriptor protocol. For example, a method/descriptor can be bound to a class as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "super works with the method resolution order (MRO) of the class. The MRO always contains at least two classes: the class itself, and object (because all classes implicitly inherit from object) >>> class ABC: pass ... >>> ABC.__mro__ (<class '__main__.ABC'>, <class 'object'>) If there are any explicitly named base classes in the class statement, those and their base classes will appear in the MRO somewhere between the new class and object. >>> class ABC(str): pass ... >>> ABC.__mro__ (<class '__main__.ABC'>, <class 'str'>, <class 'object'>) Regarding your question \"why super?\", consider this standard example: class A: def foo(self): print(\"A\") class B(A): def foo(self): super().foo() print(\"B\") class C(A): def foo(self): super().foo() print(\"C\") class D(B, C): def foo(self): super().foo() print(\"D\") The MRO for D is (D, B, C, A). Notice the call super().foo in B.foo. Looking only at the class B, you might assume that super().foo() is a call to A.foo. But when self is an instance of D (as is the case with D().foo(), for example), then super refers to C, not A, because C comes immediately after B in the MRO. >>> D().foo() A C B D foo outputs the classes in the MRO (sans object; A doesn't use super because A \"introduced\" foo into the hierarchy) in reverse order, from least to most specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses cooperative multiple inheritance. That means that your call to super() doesn't necessarily hit the base class of where it's called, it hits the next class in the method resolution order (MRO) from where you started. To demonstrate: class A: def __init__(self): print(\"A.__init__\") super().__init__() class B: def __init__(self): print(\"B.__init__\") super().__init__() class C(A, B): def __init__(self): print(\"C.__init__\") super().__init__() c = C() Gives the output: C.__init__ A.__init__ B.__init__ So the call super().__init__() inside class A calls __init__() in class B, even though class A does not inherit from class B. So long as all your classes make sure they call super where appropriate, you only need to call it once and trust that everything will cooperate. The MRO is basically the order in which python will search the classes for a method or attribute. You can examine what this order is by inspecting the __mro__ attribute on a class: print(C.__mro__) Gives us: (<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>)\n",
      "\n",
      "super is not a function; it is actually a class whose instances encapsulate knowledge about the method resolution order of the classes involved. super(B, self) returns an instance (a proxy object) that knows the MRO for whatever type self has, as well as the fact that you want to skip the classes in the MRO between self.__class__ and B. When you invoke a method on the proxy, it finds the correct method to call, then passes self as an argument to that method. Let's say the object self was an instance of a class A whose MRO looked like [A, C1, C2, C3, C4, B, C5, C6]. Normally, a call to A.foo() would check if A had a method foo, and if not, proceed to check C1, C2, etc, in order until it found a class with a method foo. super(B, self) returns a proxy that basically says, \"use an MRO of [B, C5, C6]\" so that when you write super(B, self).foo(), Python skips right to B if A.foo doesn't exist. In the vast majority of cases, super is used to just skip the instance's class itself, trimming one class off the front of the MRO. This is the behavior that Python 3 makes simple by letting you omit the arguments to super.\n",

Then the state of the pipeline object is reset and it can be safely reused by the client.

      "I think we need to dig a bit more into details here as you're mentioning different aspects here. In general, all Java Redis clients (Jedis (https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis), Lettuce (https://github.com/mp911de/lettuce), Redisson (https://github.com/redisson/redisson) and much more) write commands directly to the TCP channel by default. So each command is sent as one or multiple TCP packets. Lettuce and Redisson as their mode of operation as both clients use an asynchronous/event-driven programming model under the hood to write Redis commands to the TCP channel. Jedis forces you to await the command result since it exposes a blocking API. Redisson and Lettuce expose different kinds of API (asynchronous using Futures or reactive using RxJava/Reactive Streams) that do not force you to await the command result. Batching/buffering is another technique to collect commands in the client memory and send commands as a batch to Redis. This works with both, Lettuce (https://github.com/mp911de/lettuce/wiki/Pipelining-and-command-flushing) and Redisson (https://github.com/redisson/redisson/wiki/10.-additional-features#103-execution-batches-of-commands) clients. Jedis writes commands in its pipelining mode directly to the TCP channel. Command batching brings some implications. It's possible to auto-batch commands (say in sizes of 10 or 50) but this requires some attention by users. Batching always requires some final synchronization to avoid commands lingering in the queue and not been sent because the batch size is not reached yet. Spring Data Redis uses Jedis and Lettuce to expose its functionality, so Spring Data Redis is required to cope with the common substance of both drivers. You can set up Spring Data Redis to use connection pooling with Jedis so you benefit from pooled connections that are not closed each time you interact with Redis.\n",

      "Square brackets indicate that any of the characters inside the brackets can be used. This is called a character class. [abc] would match \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\" but not \"d\". You can also specify a range within a character class to indicate that any of the characters in the range should match. [a-e] means the same as [abcde] In your regular expression, [0-9A-Za-z._-] matches an alphanumeric character, period, underscore or hyphen. The three ranges 0-9, A-Z and a-z cover the numerals, lowercase and uppercase letters respectively. Curly brackets indicate that the preceding character can be matched multiple times. a{3,5} means \"the character 'a', repeated 3-5 times\". I.e. it matches \"aaa\" and \"aaaaa\" but not \"aa\" or \"aaaaaa\". We can combine the curly braces with the character class to indicate we want to match any character in the character class multiple times. [ab]{0, 5} means \"a mix of 'a' and 'b', between zero and five characters long\" I.e. it matches \"aa\", \"bbb\", \"ababa\" and \"\" but not \"ababab\" or \"abc\" Combining these two concepts we can see how the regex matches the text description [0-9A-Za-z._-]{0,100} means \"a mix of 0-9, A-Z, a-z, ., _ and -, between zero and a hundred characters long\"\n",

      "A dash -, when used within square brackets [], has a special meaning: it defines a range of characters. E.g., [\\s-,] means \"any character from \\s to ,\" (which is not possible).

      "The issue here lies on the fine line between specification and implementations. ECMAscript 5.1 Specification (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10.2.16) states that: A - character can be treated literally or it can denote a range. It is treated literally if it is the first or last character of ClassRanges, the beginning or end limit of a range specification, or immediately follows a range specification. Regular-Expressions.info (http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html#special) notes that: Hyphens at other positions in character classes where they can't form a range may be interpreted as literals or as errors. Regex flavors are quite inconsistent about this. Conclusions: The safe way of including a dash - minus sign in a character class is by either: escaping it (eg. [a-zA-Z0-9\\->.]) placing it as the first char. in the class (eg. [-.>a-zA-Z0-9]) exception: in a negated class it goes 2nd, right after ^ (eg. [^-.>a-zA-Z0-9]) placing it last in the class (eg. [a-zA-Z0-9.>-]) General coding guidelines suggest placing your ranges first and ending the character class with the hyphen, this avoids ambiguity and helps readability. Summing it up, your RegEx should become: /@\\{each ([a-zA-Z0-9>.-]*)\\}([\\s\\S]*)@\\{\\/each}/g As an additional tip: you could also rewrite [\\s\\S] (any whitespace char. or any non-whitespace char.) into [^] (not nothing) which would end you up with the following RegEx: /@\\{each ([a-zA-Z0-9>.-]*)\\}([^]*)@\\{\\/each}/g JavaScript ... treats [^] as a negated empty character class that matches any single character. - source (http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html#special)\n",

      "When in a character class ([ ]), dash ( - ) has a special meaning in regular expressions - it means \"range\", eg. a-z means from 'a' to 'z'. You're not escaping it, so your RegExps are not even correct (at least not in every language). Update: It appears, that this syntax is correct when dash is not surrounded by other characters (when it's placed at the beginning or end of the character class). Sorry for confusion. Try this instead: /^\\d\\-\\d+$/ It matches strings that begin with one digit, followed by a dash, and then by one or more digits.\n",

      "RegEx is explained poorly all over the web. I don't fault anyone for asking more general questions about it and this is different from the other post which is more do-it-form-me google-evasion than specific question. The characters you asked about: [A-Z] [0-9] or \\d \\( \\) - /matchme/ is a regular expression literal. This is preferable to useing the RegExp constructor because you end up having to escape your escape backslashes which gets real ugly. You can actually use regEx literals in a lot of string methods, like replace, split, etc. Without special characters following, any non-special character is about matching one character at that position in a string. Stuff in [] is a class and can match more than one KIND of character but only the character at that positions following the last position matched. You might [.- ] useful for identifying non-number characters for telephone numbers. You can also express ranges in character classes, e.g. [a-hA-H] or [4-9] But one str position at a time goes out the window when you start using the follow-up characters: ? - one or none * - 0 or many + - 1 or more Avoid the . wildcard character. It is inefficient. For some reason that I suspect goes down all the way to implementation in assembly for efficiency's sake, it checks against every single possibility rather than the 1-2 teletype whitespace characters it actually doesn't represent and there is no honest use for on a computer. More importantly, the better-performing alternative is much more powerful and helpful. Negating character classes are much faster. [^<]* represents 0 or more positions of anything that is NOT a < character. Very handy stuff for XML/SGML-style parsing which in spite of what many on Stack have said, is perfectly feasible with regEx, which is no longer technically confined to \"regular\" languages. You have to be aware of what your looking with something that allows as much sloppiness as somebody else's HTML but that's just a 'duh' in my book. Crockford warns against negating character classes in JSlint. Crockford is painfully wrong on that count. They are not only much more efficient, they also make it much easier to think through how to tokenize stuff. If there is a security risk, you can set explicit limits to the number of characters matched with {} brackets, e.g. p{2,5} - which matches two to five p chars or {5} for exactly 5 or {,5} for up to 5 or {5,} at least 5 (I think - test those last two) Other random stuff you should look up: (ph|f) - ph or f - helpful for finding phish and fish (when a class won't do, basically) ^ - represents beginning of a string - think of as a condition for the next character more than a character itself. Yes, it also negates character classes. $ - represents end of a string - same caveat as above but on the previous character. \\ - used to escape special symbols. Note: a lot of special symbols that have no meaning in character classes require no \\ inside [] \\s\\w\\d - These represent commonly used sets of characters. The first is pretty much all whitespace (js-style escapes typically have regEx equivalents) followed by w for word characters (class equivalent [a-zA-Z0-9_]) and d for digits [0-9]. Capitalize any of these for the exact opposite. There's more, like back-references, and lookaheads whose use-case scenarios are worth knowing but this is the commonly used stuff I actually remember from regular experience (bwaahaahaa). I assume you're looking for non US since you have that A-Z concern and I'm sure there's plenty of US phone-numbers regExes out there but I'd probably do something like this for US numbers: /\\(?\\d{3}[)\\-. ]?\\d{3}[\\-. ]?\\d{4}/ to match: 123-456-7890 (123)456-7890 123.456.7890 123 456 7890 1234567890 But also perhaps messily allows: (123456.7890 ...which I'm willing to live with for the sake of avoiding complexity. Resist the temptation to do it all with one expression. Sometimes it's much cleaner to eliminate trailing/leading whitespace for instance, and then hit something with an expression. Split and join methods are very powerful for tokenizing If this goes like a usual regEx conversation, somebody will shortly point out something I missed in my pattern. So yeah, test 'em out on stuff. There's sites that let you set the expression and then just plug in characters to try and break them.\n",

      "Brackets ([]) specify a character class: matching a single character in the string between []. While inside a character class, only the \\ and - have special meaning (are metacharacters): backslash \\: general escape character. hyphen -: character range. Notice, though, it must be between chars to have special meaning: [0-9] means any number between 0 and 9, while in [09-], - assumes the quality of an ordinary -, not a range. That's why, inside [], a . is just (will only match) a dot. Note: It is also worth noticing that the char ] must be escaped to be used inside a character class, such as [a-z\\]], otherwise it will close it as usual.

      "I agree with the others who have said that calling str.isalnum() would be a simpler option here. However, I would like to point out a few things with regard to the regex pattern you tried. Like Alex Baldwin said, your pattern as-is will only be looking for a single alphanumeric at the beginning of the string. So, you could potentially have anything else in the rest of the string and still get a match. What you should do instead is quantify your character class, and anchor that class to the end of the string. To test that the string contains some alphanumerics, you ought to choose the + quantifier, which looks for at least one alphanumeric. Make sure you use the $ to anchor the pattern to the end of the string, or else you could have some non-alphanumerics sneak in at the end: re.match('[A-Za-z0-9]+$', '!@#@$@$@') This will return false, of course, for the given string. The problem with using the * here is that it will return a MatchObject even against an empty string, and I assume you want there to be at least one alphanumeric character present. Notice also that using the ^ to anchor the character class to the beginning of the string is not necessary, because re.match() begins its search only at the beginning of the string. What you then want to test with your conditional is whether or not a MatchObject was returned by re.match(): valid = re.match('[A-Za-z0-9]+$', '!@#@$@$@') if valid: logUtb(f, 'Alphanumeric') else: logUtb(f, 'Unknown characters') Additional information on the quantifiers and anchors can be found in the documentation: http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html (http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html)\n",

      "To conceal a complete form component in Django, you can either use the `disabled` attribute or the `readonly` attribute. Both attributes affect how the form field behaves on the frontend, but they work differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using the `disabled` attribute:\n",
      "   - This attribute prevents the user from interacting with the form field (e.g., typing into a text field or clicking a button). It also ensures that the value of the field won't be included in the form data when submitted.\n",
      "   - In Django forms, you can set the `disabled` attribute directly on a field in the `__init__` method of your form:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from django import forms\n",
      "\n",

      "               self.fields['my_field'].disabled = True\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Using the `readonly` attribute:\n",
      "   - This attribute allows users to view the current value of the form field but prevents them from changing it. The value of the field will still be included in the form data when submitted.\n",
      "   - To set the `readonly` attribute in Django forms, you can modify the widget's attributes in the `__init__` method:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",

      "               self.fields['my_field'].widget.attrs['readonly'] = True\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Hiding the field entirely:\n",
      "   - If you want to completely hide a form field without making it uneditable or read-only, you can set the `style` attribute to \"display: none;\" on the widget:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from django import forms\n",

      "Conceptually, what am I doing when I'm loading a new Jar? Conceptually, you are not loading a new JAR. Rather, you are defining a class loader which will load code and other resources from the JAR file on demand. Is URLClassloader the only choice? In theory, you could implement your own subclass of ClassLoader, but that's not necessary for what you are trying to do. How should I form those URLs to point to a subdirectory containing more jars. This is the nub of your problem I think. The URLClassLoader (http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URLClassLoader.html) constructors interpret the URL[] argument as follows: \"Any URL that ends with a '/' is assumed to refer to a directory. Otherwise, the URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file which will be downloaded and opened as needed.\" In the first case of the quoted text above, the directory is assumed to be the root of tree containing resources to be loaded. But I gather you are trying to set up a class loader that will load from all JAR files in a given directory. To do that, you need to: Read the directory and build a list of the File objects for any JAR files. Create an array to hold the same number of URL instances. For each JAR file File, use File.toURL() to create a URL and add to the array. (Using File.toURL() means that you will get kosher \"file:\" URLs for the JAR files that will work on your platform.) Create the URLClassLoader using the URL array.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't tell us what CustomClassLoader is. But in general, the default behaviour of class loaders is to delegate to their parent, so by default all class loaders eventually delegate to the actual system class loader. Try creating a class loader without a parent. This is how it would look like with a standard classloader: URL[] urls = new URL[] {new File(\"build/classes/\").toURL()}; ClassLoader loader = new URLClassLoader(urls, null); The second constructor parameter is the parent.\n",

Try to replace your workload with one that is very suited for multiprocessing (e.g. working in a parallel on different parts of an array, matrix multiplication...) One more important thing: spawning the new processes also takes time, and for it to pay off the work done in each process needs to be significant. If you increase your loop's range a little bit, the difference should be in favor of the Multi-process version: import time from multiprocessing import Process def foobar(a): for i in range(1,10000000): a*i return if __name__ == \"__main__\": Tthreading = time.time() p1= Process(target= foobar, args=(3,)) p2 = Process(target= foobar, args= (2,)) p3 = Process(target= foobar, args= (4,)) p4 = Process(target=foobar, args=(123,)) allprocess = [p1,p2,p3,p4] for p in allprocess: p.start() for p in allprocess: p.join() print(time.time() - Tthreading) #Single-threaded Tsingle = time.time() foobar(3) foobar(2) foobar(4) foobar(123) print(time.time() - Tsingle) on my machine this outputs: 0.44509196281433105 1.3775699138641357\n",

      "The GIL is a bit of a nuisance sometimes... A lot of it is going to revolve around how you can use the GPU. Does the API your using allow you to set it running then go off and do something else, occasionally polling to see if the GPU has finished? Or maybe it can raise an event, call a callback or something like that? I'm sensing from your question that the answer is no... In which case I suspect your only choice (given that you're using Python) is multi processing. If the answer is yes then you can start off the GPU then get on with some preprocessing and plotting in the meantime and then check to see if the GPU has finished. I don't know much about Python or how it does multiprocessing, but I suspect that it involves serialisation and copying of data being sent between processes. If the quantity of data you're processing is large (I suggest getting worried at the 100's of megabytes mark. Though that's just a hunch) then you may wish to consider how much time is lost in serialising and copy that data. If you don't like the answers to that analysis then your probably out of luck so far as using Python is concerned. You say that the most time consuming part is the GPU processing? Presumably the other two parts are reasonably lengthy otherwise there would be little point trying to parallelise them. For example if the GPU was 95% of the runtime then saving 5% by parallelising the rest hardly seems worth it.\n",

      "Slow input and output is the perfect time to use threads and queues in Python. Threads have there limitations, but this is the case where they work easily and effectively. Outline of how to do this: Generally the GUI (e.g., the matplotlib window) needs to be in the main thread, so do the data collection in a second thread. In the data thread, check for new data coming in (and if you do this in some type of infinite polling loop, put in a short time.sleep to release the thread occasionally). Then, whenever needed, let the main thread know that there's some new data to be processed/displayed. Exactly how to do this depends on details of your program and your GUI, etc. You could just use a flag in the data thread that you check for from the main thread, or a theading.Event, or, e.g., if you have a wx backend for matplotlib wx.CallAfter is easy. I recommend looking through one of the many Python threading tutorials to get a sense of it, and also threading with a GUI usually has a few issues too so just do a quick google on threading with your particular backend. This sounds cumbersome as I explain it so briefly, but it's really pretty easy and powerful, and will be smoother than, e.g., reading and writing to the same file from different processes.\n",

      "If matplotlib in your program is using the QT backend (which I assume it is since you are embedding it in a Qt application), then the drawing is going to be done in thread you call the matplotlib commands from. This is going to be a problem because Qt requires that all drawing is done from the main thread. So I'm fairly certain you can't fix it simply. (if you were using GTK you could use the gtk lock to prevent the main process from interacting with the GUI while you did GUI related things from your thread, but Qt got rid of their similar lock in v4 and above). You have a few options: Try and separate out the drawing parts of matplotlib (may not even be possible?) and have them run in the main thread by sending events with QApplication.postEvent() Instead of using a thread, just use callbacks in the main thread (maybe called periodically using a QTimer or when the program is idle). This probbaly won't impact the performance of your application since the Python GIL prevents true multi-threading behaviour anyway. Use a different plotting library. I had a look over PyQtGraph (http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) the other day, and it seems to be coming along nicely. From my brief glance I think it has the ability to handle all of this behind the scenes for you, using a RemoteGraphicsView. This would launch a second process for doing the CPU intensive plotting stuff, which gets around the aforementioned Python GIL issue. Check out the examples they provide if you are interested\n",

      "You cannot speed it up using threading due to the Global Interpreter Lock (http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#threads). Certain internal state of the Python interpreter is protected by that lock, which prevents different threads that need to modify that state from running concurrently. You could speed it up by spawning actual processes using multiprocessing (http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html). Each process will run in its own interpreter, thus circumventing the limitation of threads. With multiprocessing, you can either use shared memory, or give each process its own copy/partition of the data. Depending on your task, you can either parallelize the processing of a single image by partitioning it, or you can parallelize the processing of a list of images (the latter is easily done using a pool (http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers)). If you want to use the former, you might want to store the image in an Array (http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Array) that can be accessed as shared memory, but you'd still have to solve the problem of where to write the results (writing to shared memory can hurt performance badly). Also note that certain kinds of communication between processes (Queues, Pipes, or the parameter/return-value passing of some function in the module) require the data to be serialized using Pickle (http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html). This imposes certain limitations on the data, and might create significant performance-overhead (especially if you have many small tasks). Another way for improving performance of such operations is to try writing them in Cython (http://cython.org/), which has its own support for parallelization (http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/parallelism.html) using OpenMP - I have never used that though, so I don't know how much help it can be.\n",

      "To optimize a Jupyter notebook for concurrent execution of visualization loops, you can use the multiprocessing module in Python. This allows you to spawn multiple processes that can execute tasks independently, bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that limits concurrency in Python's threading implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach is to use a Pool of worker processes. You can create a Pool object with the number of processes equal to the number of available CPU cores. Then, submit your visualization functions to the Pool using the `apply_async` method. This method returns an asynchronous result object, allowing you to continue executing other code while the visualization tasks are being processed concurrently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how to use a Pool for concurrent visualization:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from multiprocessing import Pool\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "def visualize(data):\n",
      "    # Your visualization logic here\n",
      "    plt.plot(data)\n",
      "    plt.show()\n",
      "\n",
      "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
      "    # Number of processes based on available CPU cores\n",
      "    num_processes = min(10, os.cpu_count())\n",
      "\n",
      "    with Pool(num_processes) as pool:\n",
      "        # List of data sets to visualize\n",
      "        datasets = [...]\n",
      "\n",
      "        # Submit tasks to the Pool\n",
      "        results = pool.map(visualize, datasets)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `visualize` function contains your visualization logic. Replace it with your specific visualization code. The `datasets` list should contain the data sets you want to visualize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a Pool allows you to efficiently distribute the visualization tasks across multiple processes, potentially reducing the overall execution time compared to sequentially executing the visualizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to avoid sharing mutable state between processes, as it can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior. Instead, ensure that each process has its own copy of any required data. Additionally, be mindful of the overhead associated with inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like Queues or Pipes, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more advanced scenarios, consider exploring libraries like Dask (https://dask.org/) or Numba (https://numba.pydata.org/), which offer additional abstractions and optimizations for parallel computing in Python.\n",

That said, I wonder if this isn't against the license agreement. UPDATE: Above method indeed removes the Twitter logo, as the OP suspected, but it is not that difficult to remove the profile image.

You could start by writing on Ndef (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/tech/Ndef.html) and NdefFormatable (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/tech/NdefFormatable.html) tags.

      "The only way to start the interaction of you App to an NFC Tag is via the NFC Service, but if you program it properly it is possible to achieve the your desired behaviour. First off, the manifest Intent filter are really only about telling the NFC Service to start/restart your App when a Tag of the right type comes in to range. There is an interaction with the \"launchMode\" of your App as detailed in https://stackoverflow.com/a/64834600/2373819 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/64834600/2373819) The way to handle an NFC tag when your App is running is to use enableForegroundDispatch or use the better enableReaderMode APIs which tell the NFC Service to pass you the Tag object in different ways when a Tag comes in to range. An example of the better enableReaderMode API for reading and writing is at https://stackoverflow.com/a/64921434/2373819 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/64921434/2373819) (You can ignore the writing bit) It is not the normal workflow to do something with a Tag only when you press a button as a Tag might or might not be in range, what you are actually doing in your current readTag method when you press the button is just processing the Intent that was stored when the activity was started no actually I/O for reading is being done to the Tag. The Tag UID and any NDEF message stored on the Tag will have been cached in the Tag Object/Intent when it came in to range. To do the similar with enableReaderMode in the onTagDiscovered method you would store the Tag Object is a global variable in the Activity class and then process it when you press the button with checking the Tag object is not null i.e. user has pressed the button with not Tag has every been in range. If want to read other non cached data when you press the button you need to handle Tag out or range errors and other I/O errors as you would if your were processing the Tag immediately when it came in to range, just you are more likely to have them. I would say it is always good practise when using NFC in your App to enableForegroundDispatch or use the better enableReaderMode to as the NFC service to send you the Tag Object even if you don't want to do anything with it at that point in time because it will prevent the NFC service launching another App to handle it or even itself displaying a basic information screen over the top of your App about the Tag that came in to range. e.g. have an empty method in onNewIntent or onTagDiscovered\n",

      "The TAG_DISCOVERED intent when used in the app's manifest is meant as a fall-back mechanism that is triggered only if no other app registered for more suitable NFC intents. So unless you develop for Android 2.3 (where TAG_DISCOVERED was the main NFC intent to use) you should avoid using this as the only NFC-related intent filter. However, in your case (the app is already open as I understand it) you can skip intent filtering in the manifest completely. While your app is in the foreground, you should register for the foreground tag dispatch system (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/advanced-nfc.html#foreground-dispatch). Also note that if (NfcAdapter.ACTION_TAG_DISCOVERED.isEmpty() == false){ does not really make sense as NfcAdapter.ACTION_TAG_DISCOVERED is a string constant that always contains the value android.nfc.action.TAG_DISCOVERED. So it will never be empty.\n",

This message contains predefined data structures like contact information and can therefore open a specific app with default intents. If you want specific automated actions based on an NFC tag you should create an app with the proper NFC intents in the manifest. The documentation is available online with many examples. You have to register your app to react on that type of nfc tags so that it opens when a tag is presented. The app then reads out the uid and handles that information to your liking.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Your prediction is by the same method as during training: my_output = sigmoid(np.dot(my_input, weights)) If you try using as input the first three examples of your training you will find correct outputs : my_input = [0.3,-0.1,0.1] prediction: [1.] my_input = [0.5,.3,0] prediction: [1.] my_input = [0.0,-.4,0.0] prediction: [2.25648121e-13] congratulations that you implemented your own training!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm quite rusty with ANNs, but maybe I can help. Model.predict passes the input vector through the model and returns the output tensor for each datapoint. Since the last layer in your model is a single Dense neuron, the output for any datapoint is a single value. And since you didn't specify an activation for the last layer, it will default to linear activation. Because you're solving a classification problem, you probably need sigmoid activation. If memory doesn't betray me, I believe you can get-by by solving it as a multi-class classification with 2 classes (essentially 2 output neurons with softmax activation). Essentially, line activation is not suited for classification problems. MORE NOTES: understanding your model If you want to understand the output you're getting, you have to understand the task you're training the model to solve. With each data-point, you tell the model the output for this is 1 or the output for this is 0. But it looks at the output not as a class for the input, but rather as a value from the range [0,1]. and it's being trained to emit values in this range. Have a look at the training y tensor. Let's assume an output of 0 matches the first class, and an output of 1 matches the second class. In this case, the more certain your model is about the input, the farther from 0.5 its output will be. So, a value of 0.1 means your model is sort-of certain it belongs to class 1 (closer to output value 0). If the output is 0.9999 then it thinks the input belongs to class 2 very high certainty (output is very close to 1). If the output, on the other hand, is something like 0.45 (very close to 0.5), then the model thinks \"maybe the input belongs to class 1, but I'm totally not sure about it. Hope this helped a little, I'll also upvote any answer that's more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're using binary_crossentropy. So, the output layer of your model should contain only 1 neuron. The calculation is, if the output value is greater than 0.5, it's 1. Otherwise, the output is 0. you can also tune that threshold though. To fix your problem, please change the following line model.add(Dense(2,activation='sigmoid')) to model.add(Dense(1,activation='sigmoid'))\n",
      "\n",
      "It always predicts one because of the output in your network. You have a Dense layer with one neuron, with a Softmax activation. Softmax normalizes by the sum of exponential of each output. Since there is one output, the only possible output is 1.0. For a binary classifier you can either use a sigmoid activation with the \"binary_crossentropy\" loss, or put two output units at the last layer, keep using softmax and change the loss to categorical_crossentropy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last layer should always use sigmoid (in the binary case) regardless of what you are trying to do. The sigmoid function is used to estimate the probabilities that an example is in a given class, the prediction of an example is the class which the example has the highest probability to be in. To conclude, change this: def predict(self, inputs_list): inputs = np.array(inputs_list, ndmin=2).T hidden = self.activation_function(np.dot(self.weights_ih, inputs) + self.bias_h) outputs = self.activation_function(np.dot(self.weights_ho, hidden) + self.bias_o) return outputs.flatten().tolist() to this def predict(self, inputs_list): inputs = np.array(inputs_list, ndmin=2).T hidden = self.activation_function(np.dot(self.weights_ih, inputs) + self.bias_h) outputs = sigmoid(np.dot(self.weights_ho, hidden) + self.bias_o) // create a sigmoid function return outputs.flatten().tolist() and in the training: # Feedforward hidden_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_ih, inputs) + self.bias_h hidden = self.activation_function(hidden_inputs) output_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_ho, hidden) + self.bias_o outputs = self.activation_function(output_inputs) to: # Feedforward hidden_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_ih, inputs) + self.bias_h hidden = self.activation_function(hidden_inputs) output_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_ho, hidden) + self.bias_o outputs = sigmoid(output_inputs) and # Calculate gradients output_gradient = output_errors * self.activation_function_d(output_inputs) * self.learning_rate hidden_gradient = hidden_errors * self.activation_function_d(hidden_inputs) * self.learning_rate to # Calculate gradients output_gradient = output_errors * sigmoid_d(output_inputs) * self.learning_rate hidden_gradient = hidden_errors * self.activation_function_d(hidden_inputs) * self.learning_rate\n",

So even if you are making classification, your accuracy would be 50% if you had 2 classes. Softmax outputs' sum will be equal to one. So using it with one neuron does not make sense. You need to change your loss and metric as this is a regression. loss='mse', metrics=['mse'] Also your output neuron should be linear which means does not need any activation function. It should be like: Dense(1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Your model doesn't learn anything because you used a softmax activation with one output neuron, which means that the output is constant 1.0 with any values for the weights. You should change activation to hyperbolic tangent (tanh) since it matches the range of your output [-1, 1]. You should also remove the accuracy metric since its a regression task, and accuracy only applies to classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "(as mentioned by @Frightera) np.argmax() is generally used to get max index value when there are more than 2 class probabilities. As it is a binary classification model and you have used Sigmoid (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/sigmoid) activation function in the last layer which always returns the output value between 0 to 1. Which means For small values (< 0.5), the output will be classified as zero (0), and for large values (>0.5), the result will be classified as 1. Hence, you need to replace the final few lines of your code as below: preds = model.predict(X_test) y_pred = np.where(preds > 0.5, 1, 0) #y_pred = np.argmax(model.predict(X_test), axis=-1) print(metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)) Output: 1.0\n",

For statically building your classifier, Yyou might actually want to use the heaviside function as activation function: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function).

      "You're taking the right path when thinking about try/catch blocks, but notice I used a 'catch' as well. Usually (maybe that is even enforced, I can't remember) you need the catch blocks along with the try. So your functions could look something like this: function async myFirstTryCatch() { try { // Make your request in the try block await requestCall(); } catch(error){ // Hey, my http call returned an error // Deal with the error here. Maybe show a toast, validate a form // Anything you need to not break the code and have good UX console.log(error) } } In that same line of thought, you could have each function handle their own try/catch or maybe control that in your apply function, in case some of the chain must continue/stop depending each other. function apply() { try { firstCall(); functionThatRequiresFirstCalltoSucceed(); } catch (error){ //Will catch if either firstCall or functionThatRequiresFirstCalltoSucceed fail console.log(error) } functionThatIndependsFromTheResultAbove(); } I hope this will help you build your thoughts about error handling in JS :) IMPORTANT NOTE If your code enters the catch block, it will consider that the error has been dealt with and will not propagate! Here's an example function functionThatThrowsError(){ try{ throw new Error('Example Error!'); } catch (error) { // Error has been dealt with console.log(error) // Returns \"Example Error\" // throw error; <--- Throw the error in the catch block if you need t to propagate } } function wontCatchError() { try { functionThatThrowsError(); } catch (error) { // THE CODE WILL NOT ENTER THE CATCH BLOCK // SINCE THE ERROR WAS CAUGHT IN THE FUNCTION ITSELF. // If you need to catch here as well, make sure to throw the error // in the catch block of the 'functionThatThrowsError' console.log(error) } }\n",

      "Using request-promise (https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) for your issue is a good idea because promises are better equiped to handle async code than callbacks, especially when dealing with multiple requests and error handling.

The success callback in promises is passed into the then hook, not into the initial promise construction. Additionally, the error isn't passed to the success (first) callback but is caught in the rejection (second) callback (or in the catch hook). For the second request, you are actually trying to make multiple request, one for every url in the provided array. To ensure all those request are finished before proceeding, you should use Promise.all (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all). Here's how you'd structure your promises using request-promise. request({ uri: url, json: true }) // this is how the docs for request-promise say you can request a json .then(function (json) { // accumulate array of urls and pass them along the promise chain var urls = []; for (var i = 0; i < json.length; i++) { urls.push(json[i].url) } return urls; }) .then(function (urls) { var promises = []; for (var i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) { promises.push(request(urls[i])); // create a promise for each url and fire off the request } return Promise.all(promises); // continue down the chain once all promises (request) are resolved }) .then(function (arrayOfResultsFromEachPreviousRequest) { // ... }); Using ES6 arrow functions (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and Array.prototype.map (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), you can reduce the code even further: request({ url: url, json: true }) .then(json => json.map(item => item.url)) .then(urls => Promise.all(urls.map(url => request(url)))) .then(arrayOfResultsFromEachPreviousRequest => { // ... }); If you want to use the callback-styled request, things would be much more painful, especially the second part that waits on multiple requests. For comparison purposes, here's an approach using callback (hell (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch2.md)) without error handling: request.get({ url:url, json:true }, function(err, res, json) { var urls = []; for (var i = 0; i < json.length; i++) { urls.push(json[i].url) } makeRemainingRequests(urls, function(arrayOfResultsFromEachPreviousRequest) { // ... }); }); function makeRemainingRequests(urls, cb) { var results = new Array(urls.length).fill(false); // array holding the results of all requests for (var i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) { // wrap each request in an IIFE so we have a correct value of i (function(idx) { request(urls[idx], function(err, res, body) { results[idx] = body; // if all results obtained, call the callback if (results.every(function (res) { return !!res; })) { cb(results); } }); })(i); } }\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to return the Promise in your catch in order to be able to chain from it too: .catch(error => { counter++; // return Fetch next URL return ajax(urls[counter]); });\n",
      "\n",
      "In most promise libs, you could chain .fail() or .catch() as in @mido22's answer, but jQuery's .fail() doesn't \"handle\" an error as such. It is guaranteed always to pass on the input promise (with unaltered state), which would not allow the required \"break\" of the cascade if/when success happens. The only jQuery Promise method that can return a promise with a different state (or different value/reason) is .then(). Therefore you could write a chain which continues on error by specifying the next step as a then's error handler at each stage. function getDataUntilAsyncSuccess() { return $.Deferred().reject() .then(null, getData1) .then(null, getData2) .then(null, getData3); } //The nulls ensure that success at any stage will pass straight through to the first non-null success handler. getDataUntilAsyncSuccess().then(function (x) { //\"success\" data is available here as `x` }, function (err) { console.log('not found'); }); But in practice, you might more typically create an array of functions or data objects which are invoked in turn with the help of Array method .reduce(). For example : var fns = [ getData1, getData2, getData3, getData4, getData5 ]; function getDataUntilAsyncSuccess(data) { return data.reduce(function(promise, fn) { return promise.then(null, fn); }, $.Deferred().reject());// a rejected promise to get the chain started } getDataUntilAsyncSuccess(fns).then(function (x) { //\"success\" data is available here as `x` }, function (err) { console.log('not found'); }); Or, as is probably a better solution here : var urls = [ '/path/1/', '/path/2/', '/path/3/', '/path/4/', '/path/5/' ]; function getDataUntilAsyncSuccess(data) { return data.reduce(function(promise, url) { return promise.then(null, function() { return getData(url);// call a generalised `getData()` function that accepts a URL. }); }, $.Deferred().reject());// a rejected promise to get the chain started } getDataUntilAsyncSuccess(urls).then(function (x) { //\"success\" data is available here as `x` }, function (err) { console.log('not found'); });\n",
      "\n",
      "I am putting catches at the end That's the typical position for them - you handle all errors that were occurring somewhere in the chain. It's important not to forget to handle errors at all, and having a catch-all in the end is the recommended practise. even if I use onreject handlers in all .then(…) calls? That's a bit odd. Usually all errors are handled in a central location (the catch in the end), but of course if you want you can handle them anywhere and then continue with the chain. Just make sure to understand the difference between an onreject handler in a then and in a catch (https://stackoverflow.com/a/24663315/1048572), and you can use them freely. Still, the catch in the end is recommended to catch errors in the then callbacks themselves. they are returning empty object in one particular instance atleast. Then the promise screwed up - it should never reject without a reason. Seems to be caused be the if ( !app.ajax.url ) { console.log(\"need ajax url\"); promise.reject(); } in your code that should have been a if (!app.ajax.url) return Promise.reject(\"need ajax url\"); Is a catch necessary for anything unbeknownst? Not really. The problem is that catch is usually a catch-all, even catching unexpected exceptions. So if you can distinguish them, what would you do with the unexpected ones? Usually you'd set up some kind of global unhandled rejection handler (https://stackoverflow.com/q/28709666/1048572) for those, so that you do not have to make sure to handle them manually at the end of every promise chain.\n",

If you want to add an error handler and keep the chain in a rejected state - you need to throw the error. Better yet, don't attach the error handler in this case to begin with. return Promise.resolve($.ajax(options)); // that's all folks!\n",

      "When working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript, such as AJAX calls, modularizing your code using modules and handling asynchronous callbacks efficiently becomes crucial. Here's how you can leverage modules and asynchronous callbacks together effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Modularize Your Code**: Break your code into smaller, reusable modules. Each module should encapsulate specific functionality, making your codebase easier to maintain and test.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use Promises for Asynchronous Operations**: Promises are an excellent way to handle asynchronous operations because they allow you to chain operations and handle errors gracefully. Libraries like Bluebird (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) or native Promise support in modern browsers offer robust tools for managing asynchronous tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Asynchronous Callback Handling**: When dealing with callbacks, ensure that you handle them properly. You can either pass the callbacks directly to the functions that perform the asynchronous operations or use techniques like higher-order functions to manage them.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Higher-Order Functions**: Use higher-order functions to manage callbacks. A higher-order function takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. This allows you to abstract away the callback management logic, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.\n",

      "There are numerous ways to achieve this. The first option below uses only rectangles, the second and third option use svg paths (all three options simplify positioning, modifiction of selection, changing shape from one to the other.) The fourth option is an append where the elements vary between rect and circle. Round some Rectangles If your shapes are circle and square, perhaps the easiest is to use rectangles with rx (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/rx), ry (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/ry) properties so that some rectangles appear like rectangles, and others like circles: var data = [ {x: 100, y: 100, circle: true}, {x: 200, y: 100, circle: false} ] var width = 20; d3.select(\"body\") .append(\"svg\") .selectAll(null) .data(data) .enter() .append(\"rect\") .attr(\"x\",d=>d.x) .attr(\"y\",d=>d.y) .attr(\"rx\",d=>d.circle?width/2:0) .attr(\"ry\",d=>d.circle?width/2:0) .attr(\"width\", width) .attr(\"height\",width); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.7.0/d3.min.js\"></script> Use D3.symbol Instead of rects or circles, we could use paths, d3.symbol returns pathing data and has a circle and a rectangle, d3.symbol has a size method if we wish to alter the size (symbols are centered on their centering coordinate, like a circle): var data = [ {x: 100, y: 100, circle: true}, {x: 200, y: 100, circle: false} ] var width = 20; d3.select(\"body\") .append(\"svg\") .selectAll(null) .data(data) .enter() .append(\"path\") .attr(\"transform\",d=>\"translate(\"+[d.x,d.y]+\")\") .attr(\"d\", function(d) { var symbol = d.circle ? d3.symbolCircle : d3.symbolSquare; return d3.symbol().type(symbol).size(300)(); }) <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.7.0/d3.min.js\"></script> Make your own Paths Instead of symbols we can just have a function that returns the path data for a circle or a rect, gives you more flexibility than d3.symbol, but loses some of the simplicity of it (such as easy rescaling of symbols): var data = [ {x: 100, y: 100, circle: true}, {x: 200, y: 100, circle: false} ] var width = 20; d3.select(\"body\") .append(\"svg\") .selectAll(null) .data(data) .enter() .append(\"path\") .attr(\"transform\",d=>\"translate(\"+[d.x,d.y]+\")\") .attr(\"d\", pather) function pather(d) { if(d.circle) { return \"M10,10m-10,0a10,10 0 1,0 20,0a 10,10 0 1,0 -20,0\" } else { return \"M0,0L0,20L20,20L20,0Z\"; } } <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.7.0/d3.min.js\"></script> Create rects and circles at the same time with one append selection.append() can take a function - whatever element is returned by the function is appended to the DOM. To make our node, we'll create a detached SVG element and add a circle to that. var data = [ {x: 100, y: 100, circle: true}, {x: 200, y: 100, circle: false} ] var width = 20; d3.select(\"body\") .append(\"svg\") .selectAll(null) .data(data) .enter() .append(makeShape) function makeShape(d) { // create a temporary svg let svg = document.createElementNS(d3.namespaces.svg, \"svg\") // create an element: if(d.circle) { return d3.select(svg) .append(\"circle\") .attr(\"cx\",d.x) .attr(\"cy\",d.y) .attr(\"r\", 10) .node() // return node, not selection. } else { return d3.select(svg) .append(\"rect\") .attr(\"x\",d.x) .attr(\"y\",d.y) .attr(\"width\", 20) .attr(\"height\", 20) .node(); } } <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.7.0/d3.min.js\"></script> But now you have a selection of circles and rectangles - much more awkward to deal with later.\n",

For example, if you have an (x,y) point, you would need to create a named helper function like dToString = function(d) {return \"(\" + d.x + \",\" + d.y + \")\";}, and then pass in the name of that function when you set the attribute, and use it again when you compare the old and new.\n",

      "To switch D3 shapes based on a true/false condition, you can use various methods depending on your specific needs. Here are four approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using `rx` and `ry` properties:**\n",
      "   This method uses rectangles with rounded corners to simulate circles. Set the `rx` and `ry` attributes to half the width for circular appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   var data = [\n",
      "     { x: 100, y: 100, circle: true },\n",
      "     { x: 200, y: 100, circle: false }\n",
      "   ];\n",
      "   var width = 20;\n",
      "\n",
      "   d3.select(\"body\")\n",

      "    .attr(\"width\", width)\n",
      "    .attr(\"height\", width);\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Using `d3.symbol`:**\n",
      "   This approach employs D3's built-in symbol function to generate circle and square paths dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   var data = [\n",
      "     { x: 100, y: 100, circle: true },\n",
      "     { x: 200, y: 100, circle: false }\n",

      "     });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",

      "ISO 8601 That format is one of a family of date-time string formats defined by the ISO 8601 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard. Python Looks like many duplicates of your Question for Python. Search Stack Overflow for: Python \"ISO 8601\" (https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=python%20%22ISO%208601%22). Get 233 hits. java.time On the Java side, you are working too hard. And you are using troublesome old legacy classes now supplanted by the java.time classes. The java.time classes use ISO 8601 formats by default when parsing/generating strings that represent date-time values. So no need to define a formatting pattern. Note that Java 8 has some bugs or limitations with parsing all variations of ISO 8601, remedied in Java 9. String input = \"2016-09-20T01:28:03.238+02:00\" ; OffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime.parse ( input ) ; Ditto, for going the other direction in ISO 8601 format, no need to define a formatting pattern. String output = odt.toString () ; // 2016-09-20T01:28:03.238+02:00 If you really need a java.util.Date for old code not yet updated to the java.time types, you can convert using new methods added to the old classes. Fractional second Beware of the fractional second. The java.time classes handle values with up to nanosecond (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond) resolution, nine digits of decimal fraction. The Python datetime type (https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html) seems to have a microseconds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond) resolution, for six decimal places. The old legacy date-time classes in Java are limited to millisecond (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond) resolution, for three digits of decimal fraction. The ISO 8601 standard prescribes no limit to the fraction, any number of decimal fraction digits. When going from Python to Java, this is another reason to avoid the old date-time classes and stick with java.time classes. When going from Java to python, you may want to truncate any nanoseconds value to microseconds as defined by ChronoUnit.MICROS (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/ChronoUnit.html#MICROS). Instant instant = Instant.now().truncatedTo( ChronoUnit.MICROS ) ; About java.time The java.time (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old date-time classes such as java.util.Date (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), .Calendar (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), & java.text.SimpleDateFormat (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). The Joda-Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in maintenance mode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to java.time. To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 & 7 in ThreeTen-Backport (http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/) and further adapted to Android (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) in ThreeTenABP (https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) (see How to use… (https://stackoverflow.com/q/38922754/642706)). The ThreeTen-Extra (http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as Interval (http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html), YearWeek (http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html), YearQuarter (http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html), and more (http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/index.html).\n",

UTC or Coordinated Universal Time is not a format, it is a standard time used to define the time the rest of use in our respective time zones. The date-time classes you were using, SimpleDateFormat and Date, are long outdated and the former in particular notoriously troublesome. I recommend that you instead use java.time, the modern Java date and time API. It is so much nicer to work with. A LocalDateTime is a date with time of day and without time zone or offset from UTC. Its one-argument parse method parses ISO 8601, which is why no explicit formatter is needed. What went wrong in your code Your format pattern string has a number of issues to it. Which is one reason why you should appreciate the above solution without any explicit formatter. The first thing that goes wrong is: Your format pattern string has a colon, :, between seconds and milliseconds, whereas your date-time string has a dot, .. This is why you get the exception. However, fixing this, your code yields the following Date: Sun Dec 31 23:00:00 CET 2017 It’s one month off from the expected, and the minutes and seconds are missing. Because: Uppercase YYYY is for week-based year and only useful with a week number. You need lowercase yyyy for year. Uppercase DD is for day of year. You need lowercase dd for day of month. You correctly used uppercase MM for month. Trying the same again for minutes won’t work. Maybe you can guess by now: it’s lowercase mm. Not surprising you need lowercase ss for seconds. UsingMS for milliseconds is interesting. SimpleDateFormat takes it as M for month (which we’ve already had twice before) and uppercase S for millisecond. Instead you needed uppercase SSS for the three digits of milliseconds. Links Oracle tutorial: Date Time (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/) explaining how to use java.time. Wikipedia article: ISO 8601 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) Wikipedia article: Coordinated Universal Time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) on UTC\n",

      "Date and time formats are specified by pattern strings. Within the pattern strings, m is interpreted as minute in hour, and M is interpreted as Month in year. Perhaps you should read JavaDoc API spec (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). And you should check that the year of parsed date object is what you intended to. Since your string is MM-dd-yyy, \"02-12-014\"(which should be 2014-02-12 is actually interpreted as 0014-02-12, which can be not your intended result.\n",

      "You already have a datetime object, you do not need to parse it again. The datetime.fromtimestamp() call was enough. Remove the datetime.strptime() line. created_date = datetime.fromtimestamp(ctime) created_date = created_date.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p\") print(created_date) I also changed your strftime() call, it is a method, you just call it on the datetime object you have. I suspect that you printed the return value of the datetime.fromtimestamp() call, and got confused. The str() conversion of a datetime() instance (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.__str__) formats the value as a ISO 8601 string (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat). Note that even if you did have a string, you used the wrong format (there is no timezone in that string, so %Z does not apply). If you needed a datetime object, rather than a formatted string, you could also just have converted your timestamp to an integer; the microseconds are captured in the decimal portion of the timestamp: >>> ctime = 1505252035.28109 >>> datetime.fromtimestamp(ctime) datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 12, 22, 33, 55, 281090) >>> datetime.fromtimestamp(int(ctime)) datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 12, 22, 33, 55) >>> print(_) 2017-09-12 22:33:55\n",

The problem you have observed with your code is one of the weird problems that you face with SimpleDateFormat. Instead of throwing the exception because of the wrong format, SimpleDateFormat tries to parse the date string erroneously. Solution using java.time, the modern Date-Time API: import java.time.LocalDate; import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter; import java.time.format.DateTimeParseException; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { String sFecha = \"10/21/2021\"; try { DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"dd/MM/yyyy\"); LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse(sFecha, dtf); System.out.println(date); } catch (DateTimeParseException e) { System.out.println(\"A problem occured while parsing the date string.\"); // ...Handle the exception } } } Output: A problem occured while parsing the date string. Now, change the format to MM/dd/yyyy and you will see that the date string will be parsed successfully. Learn more about the modern Date-Time API from Trail: Date Time (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/index.html). In case you want to use SimpleDateFormat: Pass false to SimpleDateFormat#setLenient (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html#setLenient(boolean)) which is set true by deafult. Demo: import java.text.SimpleDateFormat; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { String sFecha = \"10/21/2021\"; try { SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"dd/MM/yyyy\"); sdf.setLenient(false); System.out.println(sdf.format(sdf.parse(sFecha))); } catch (java.text.ParseException e) { System.out.println(\"A problem occured while parsing the date string.\"); // ...Handle the exception } } } Output: A problem occured while parsing the date string. * If you are working for an Android project and your Android API level is still not compliant with Java-8, check Java 8+ APIs available through desugaring (https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support-table).

      "The issue lies in the format pattern string used in the `SimpleDateFormat` constructor. In your original code, the format pattern string has several issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The colon (:) separates seconds and milliseconds, but your input string uses a dot (.) for milliseconds.\n",
      "2. Uppercase YYYY represents week-based year, not a four-digit year. Use lowercase yyyy instead.\n",
      "3. Uppercase DD represents day of year, not day of month. Use lowercase dd instead.\n",
      "4. Uppercase MM represents month, which is correct in your case.\n",
      "5. There's no directive for minutes (m), so they are assumed to be zero. Use lowercase mm for minutes.\n",
      "6. Uppercase SS represents milliseconds, but you need three digits (SSSS). Use uppercase SSSS instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the corrected format pattern string: `\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSS\"`\n",

You have: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN>\" \"w3.org/TR/xhtml/DTD/xhtml-transitional.dtd\">; But, it should be: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"> And that's only if you really want to use the XHTML 1.0 Transitional document type, which most-likely you don't since that is an old and rarely used document type these days.

To validate your HTML, you can go to http://validator.w3.org (http://validator.w3.org) and paste your code into their online validation tool. If you do that with your current code, you will see that it indicates that the document can't even be checked and that's because of the invalid DOCTYPE.

      "JavaScript may fail to execute within an XHTML document due to several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Invalid DOCTYPE Declaration**: Ensure your document type declaration is correct. For HTML5, use `<!DOCTYPE html>`. For older XHTML versions, ensure the correct DTD URL is provided. Incorrect DOCTYPE can cause browsers to interpret the document as XML, leading to parsing errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inline Script Tags**: Inline scripts within XHTML documents should be wrapped in CDATA sections to tell the parser not to interpret the content as XML. For example:\n",
      "   ```html\n",
      "   <script type=\"text/javascript\"> <![CDATA[\n",

      "   </script>\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "3. **Use of `<` Characters**: XHTML is more strict than HTML and treats `<` as a start of a new tag. If your JavaScript contains `<`, it will cause parsing issues. Wrap such code in a CDATA section.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **External JavaScript Files**: Avoid inlining JavaScript directly in the XHTML file. Instead, link to external `.js` files using `<script src=\"...\"></script>`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Browser MIME Type Handling**: Some browsers treat `.xhtml` files differently based on the MIME type. Serve your files with the appropriate MIME type (`application/xhtml+xml` for XHTML or `text/html` for HTML) to avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **`document.write()` Usage**: The `document.write()` method is not supported in XHTML documents, especially those served with the `application/xhtml+xml` MIME type.\n",

      "7. **File Extension**: Ensure your file has the correct extension (.html or.htm for HTML,.xhtml for XHTML). Browsers interpret files differently based on their extensions.\n",

Leading and trailing spaces are allowed. If the first character cannot be converted to a number, parseFloat returns NaN. To check if a string is a number you can use (from Validate decimal numbers in JavaScript - IsNumeric() (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18082/validate-numbers-in-javascript-isnumeric)) function isNumber(n) { return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n); }\n",

If it encounters an invalid character, it returns the number represented up to that point, ignoring the invalid character and all characters following it. The only time that parseFloat will return NaN is literally when the first non-whitespace character in the string cannot be parsed (i.e. there is no number represented up to that point). Demo: f = parseFloat tests = [ ' 1', ' 1a', '1a', 'a', ' a' ] for (test of tests) { console.log(`${f.name}('${test}'):${f(test)}`) } This differs to the behavior of Number() (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number): When used as a function, Number(value) converts a string or other value to the Number type.

      "\n",
      "The `parseFloat()` and `Number()` functions consistently yield `NaN` (Not-a-Number) when extracting values from a `div` element due to their behavior in handling strings. Both functions attempt to parse a number from the beginning of the string until they encounter a character that cannot be converted into a number. At that point, they stop and return the value they've successfully parsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of web development, if you're retrieving the value from a `<div>` element using `document.getElementById(\"number\").value`, you're actually fetching the initial, empty string (`\"\"`). When attempting to parse this empty string as a number using `parseFloat()` or `Number()`, you get `NaN` because an empty string cannot be converted to a number.\n",
      "\n",
      "To obtain the correct value, you should retrieve a reference to the input element itself using `const numberCorrect = document.getElementById(\"number\")`. By doing so, you capture the actual DOM element, allowing you to access its updated value through `numberCorrect.value`. This ensures you're working with the current user input rather than an initial, empty string.\n",

      "If you want to ensure that the extracted value is a valid number, you can implement additional validation steps. For example, you can trim whitespace using `trim()`, remove non-numeric characters, and validate the resulting string against a regular expression.

The simplest solution would be to add ngAnimate and ui.bootstrap in your app.js like this: var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute','ngAnimate','ui.bootstrap']); If you don't want to have all your dependencies in your root module, you can make submodules like var controllers = angular.module('myApp.controllers', ['ngAnimate']), and include this in your app.js like var app = angular.module('myApp', ['myApp.controllers']);\n",

Instead you inject the module's services, providers, controllers etc.. with $inject annotation of array annotation so that they are minification safe.

Long answer: Your ngRoute dependency should be loaded in the main module because is something which your app module is going to need it to define the basic routing, if the dependency is loaded in several modules is not going to throw any error, in fact you should add all the dependencies needed by each module because in large applications there is no guarantee that the ngRoute/myFactory/etc is already loaded.

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The most efficient way to bind a large number of similar elements to a single event is to make use of event bubbling. You attach a single event handler to a common parent object and then, in the single event handler, you examine which object the event originated in to see if the original object is an object you're monitoring for this event. For attaching the event, it costs you only a single event handler and you can serve an infinite number of child objects from that one event handler. There's a slight performance degradation at the run-time of each event (probably not noticeable) because the event has to bubble up to a parent before the event handler sees it and the event handler has to check if the source object is a desired target object or not. But, it's massively more efficient to install the one single event handler rather than installing thousands of individual event handlers. Delegated event handling also has the advantage that it works well for dynamically created objects, even objects created after the event handler was installed - something that doesn't not work well for event handlers installed directly on the objects themselves (non-delegated event handlers). In jQuery, you can use delegated event handling like this: $(common parent selector).on('click', selector of target objects, function() {}); For example, HTML: <div id=\"parent\"> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> <button class=\"addButton\">Add</button> </div> Code: $(\"#parent\").on('click', \".addButton\", function(e) { // the value of `this` is set to the object that originated the event // e.g. what was clicked on });\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, here's a similar question/answer with some pertinent info to understanding this issue: Should all jquery events be bound to $(document)? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12824549/should-all-jquery-events-be-bound-to-document/12824698#12824698). Here are some notes on large numbers of event handlers and performance: 30+ is NOT a large number of event handlers. In most cases, you shouldn't have to worry about 30+ event handlers at all (see possible exception below if you have nasty selectors). If event handlers are attached directly to the intended object (the most efficient way for them to be processed at the actual event time), you will maximize your run-time performance. If you are using delegated event handling, then event handlers should be placed on a parent that is as close as possible to the actual object receiving the event. Putting all delegated event handlers on a top level object like document or document.body is generally a bad idea because that makes the code have to look at more selectors for every event than if the event handlers are closer to the actual object that triggers the event thus avoiding evaluating most of the selectors for most events. If you are using delegated event handling, then the performance of the secondary selector (the 2nd argument to .on()) is important. If this is a complicated selector that is not fast to evaluate and you have a lot of these all attached to the same object for the same event, you could start to see some performance degradation. How much performance degradation will depend upon the exact circumstances. So, the worst case is if you have a lot of delegated event handlers all attached to the same object that all have a complicated secondary selector. This is the worst case because the event will have to bubble up to this parent object and then jQuery will have to go through every one of the delegated events for this particular event and it will have to evaluate the secondary selector argument to see if it matches the target object. If you have a lot of these delegated event handlers on the same object and you the secondary selector is somewhat complicated, it's possible that the time to process all this could start to be noticeable. As with any performance issue, if this is really important to you, then you need to do your own performance testing. Install 30 delegated 'click' handlers with secondary selectors like you will be using to the document object in a sample page and try it. See if you can see any performance degradation at all between the click and the response to the click. Try it with 100 event handlers, 1000 event handlers, etc... until you see where it becomes noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best practice to handle \"multiple\" event handlers for \"many\" elements is event delegation, which is basically what you described. Create a listener on the closest shared parent (document.body will of course do it for any element, but maybe there is another parent node below that). Performance should not be the issue there. It's far worse to create like 200 event handler functions instead of one.\n",
      "\n",
      "No need for hundreds of event listeners when one delegated listener will suffice. Make sure all the elements have same class and do $(document).on('click', '.button-class', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); /* \"this\" is element event occured on */ // do ajax with data relevant to this button })\n",
      "\n",
      "What you're missing is there are different elements of the performance. Your first example performs worse when setting up the click handler, but performs better when the actual event is triggered. Your second example performs better when setting up the click handler, but performs significantly worse when the actual event is triggered. If all events were put on a top level object (like the document), then you'd have an enormous list of selectors to check on every event in order to find which handler function it goes with. This very issue is why jQuery deprecated the .live() method because it looks for all events on the document object and when there were lots of .live() event handlers registered, performance of each event was bad because it had to compare every event to lots and lots of selectors to find the appropriate event handler for that event. For large scale work, it's much, much more efficient to bind the event as close to the actual object that triggered the event. If the object isn't dynamic, then bind the event right to the object that will trigger it. This might cost a tiny bit more CPU when you first bind the event, but the actual event triggering will be fast and will scale. jQuery's .on() and .delegate() can be used for this, but it is recommended that you find to an ancestor object that is as close as possible to the triggering object. This prevents a buildup of lots of dynamic events on one top level object and prevents the performance degradation for event handling. In your example above, it's perfectly reasonable to do: $(\"#someTable\").on('click', \"td.foo\", function(e) { $(e.target).doSomething(); }); That would give you one compact representation of a click handler for all rows and it would continue to work even as you added/removed rows. But, this would not make as much sense: $(document).on('click', \"#someTable td.foo\", function(e) { $(e.target).doSomething(); }); because this would be mixing the table events in with all other top level events in the page when there is no real need to do that. You are only asking for performance issues in the event handling without any benefit of handling the events there. So, I think the short answer to your question is that handling all events in one top level place leads to performance issues when the event is triggered as the code has to sort out which handler should get the event when there are a lot of events being handled in the same place. Handling the events as close to the generating object as practical makes the event handling more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would suggest doing stuff.on over $(stuff[i]).on because jQuery essentially does that for you under the hood. If you look at the source code (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L829) you'll see that they do the following: return this.each( function() { jQuery.event.add( this, types, fn, data, selector ); }); where add is the actual function used to attach event listeners. If you're absolutely concerned with performance than you can push it faster by bypassing jQuery all together and attach listeners more manually: function onChangeListener() { ... } for (var i = 0, len = stuff.length; i < len; i++) { stuff[i].addEventListener('change', onChangeListener); } But addEventListener isn't 100% supported by older browsers and jQuery will take care of that detail for you. Another major detail to keep in mind is that every time you do $(something) a new object is created which will definitely make the second method less performant. If at all possible, you may want to attach to the parent element (assuming everything in stuff is under a common parent) and pick up the events there. That will definitely be the best option if applicable. TL;DR Just do $(selector).on(event, callback). You'll save yourself some cycles, memory, and heartache.\n",

      "\n",
      "To enhance the efficiency of event mapping with jQuery's `.on()` method, especially when dealing with multiple similar elements, consider using event delegation. Event delegation allows you to attach a single event handler to a parent element, which can handle events for its descendants. This approach significantly reduces the overhead compared to attaching individual event handlers to each element.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use `.on()` for event delegation**: Attach the event handler to a common parent element (preferably the nearest static ancestor) rather than to each individual element.\n",
      "2. **Selector order matters**: Place the target element selector before the event type. For example, `'.addButton'` comes before `'click'`.\n",
      "3. **Performance benefits**: Reduces the number of event handlers, minimizing memory usage and improving performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.\n",
      "4. **Dynamic elements**: Works seamlessly with dynamically added elements, as long as they match the target selector.\n",
      "5. **Avoid unnecessary delegation**: Don't delegate to `document` unless necessary, as it can lead to increased selector evaluation during event handling. Instead, delegate to the nearest static ancestor that contains all potential targets.\n",

      "What does it really mean that the error occurred in a non-container thread? This happens when you are using JSP 3.0+ asynchronous request processing. In asynchronous mode, the client request is received by a \"container\" thread that calls the Servlet's service() method.

This executor then processes the requests on (\"non-container\") worker threads. (A more detailed explanation of what is going on in async mode, complete with an example, can be found here (http://www.softwareengineeringsolutions.com/blogs/2010/08/13/asynchronous-servlets-in-servlet-spec-3-0/).) Anyhow, the \"INFO:\" message is simply saying that the original exception was thrown on the stack of one of the Executor's worker threads. It is produced when Tomcat decides to dispatch the failed request back to a a container thread so that the request cleanup can be performed. In your example, I suspect that the original SocketException was caused by the request processing taking so long that the client (e.g. the user's browser) timed out the request and closed the socket. Some time later, your server tried to write the response and that failed because the connection had been closed. How can I recreate that? I am guessing, but you should be able to reproduce that \"INFO:\" message by throwing an exception in the Runnable's run() method. You have to use async mode of course.\n",

      "The only thing that affected this \"inactivity timeout\" appears to be the <Connector port=\"8080\" ... connectionTimeout=30000 /> setting. And only if it's trying to actively 'send data' onto the wire (but can't because the client is actively refusing it or if the connection has been lost). If the servlet is just busy doing cpu in the background, then writes to the wire (and it's received or buffered by the kernel), no problem, it can exceed the connectionTimeout, so it's not this (https://stackoverflow.com/q/7145131/32453). My hunch is that Tomcat seems to have a \"built in\" (undocumented? not able to be specified separately?) write timeout setting, which defaults to connectionTimeout value, ex (from the tomcat source, randomly selected): java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/NioEndpoint.java 625: ka.setWriteTimeout(getConnectionTimeout()); Now whether this is \"bad\" or not is subject to interpretation. Running into this \"severing\" of the connection by tomcat occurs after either the TCP channel has been disrupted somehow (enough to stop transfer) or the client is \"blocking\" on receiving the bytes, FWIW... FWIW connectionTimeout setting affects many things (http://tomcat-configure.blogspot.com/2014/04/tomcat-connectiontimeout-configuration.html): The total amount of time it takes to receive an HTTP GET request. The total amount of time between receipt of TCP packets on a POST or PUT request. The total amount of time between ACKs on transmissions of TCP packets in responses. and now apparently also a writeTimeout. End result: we had a flakey network so these are \"expected\" timeouts/severed connections (via a config with a different name LOL).\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering is likely due to a combination of factors, including port conflicts, resource contention, and potentially a write timeout in Tomcat. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshooting and resolving this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check for Port Conflicts:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that the port Tomcat is configured to use (default is 8080) is not being used by another application.\n",
      "   - Modify the `server.xml` file located in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation. Look for the `<Connector>` element and adjust the `port` attribute accordingly.\n",
      "   - If using Eclipse's embedded Tomcat server, navigate to the configured Tomcat directory, locate `server.xml`, and update the port. Rebuild and restart the server.\n",
      "   - Alternatively, you can specify the port using the Maven command: `mvn tomcat7:run -Dmaven.tomcat.port=8081`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Address Resource Contention:**\n",
      "   - Check if any other process is holding a lock on files in your Tomcat instance directory. Stop all unnecessary processes and ensure Tomcat is fully terminated before starting it again.\n",
      "   - Be cautious when editing configuration files while Tomcat is running; avoid leaving open editors that might interfere with file locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Configure Tomcat for More Concurrent Connections:**\n",
      "   - Increase the maximum number of threads in the Tomcat thread pool by modifying the `maxThreads` attribute in the `<Connector>` element within `server.xml`:\n",
      "     ```xml\n",
      "     <Connector port=\"8080\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\" redirectPort=\"8443\" maxThreads=\"420\" acceptCount=\"142\"/>\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Alternatively, if using Spring Boot, modify the `server.tomcat.max-threads` property in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:\n",
      "     ```properties\n",
      "     server.tomcat.max-threads=420\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Investigate Write Timeouts:**\n",
      "   - Consider adding a custom write timeout configuration if the default behavior is causing issues. This can be done via the `connectionTimeout` attribute in `server.xml` or through Spring Boot properties.\n",
      "   - Note that Tomcat's internal write timeout is influenced by the `connectionTimeout` value, which controls various aspects of request\n",

      "DRY is nothing that requires examples. If you are copying and pasting blocks of code from one method, function or block of code to another, then you are in violation of DRY. Very simply, DRY tells you to move that code into a reusable unit: either into a function or method or macro, or other mechanism relevant to your programming language. If you have places in your codebase where you clearly have very similar code (even with minor variations) then you should be looking to refactor that code to make it DRY. \"Don't repeat yourself!\" == \"Don't write the same code repeatedly\"\n",

If so, that is because you're updating the entire list, even if only a single item in the data was changed. To improve this, you'll want to more granularly update the adapter for changes. To do so, you can attach a ChildEventListener, which fires events at one level lower in your data structure. So say a new node is added to your list, instead of rebuilding the entire list to add the one node, you'd get a single onChildAdded call with just the one new node. You'd then update listStepsList instead of rebuilding it, and tell the adapter about the changes. For an example of this, I recommend checking out FirebaseUI, as the adapters in there (https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/tree/master/database/src/main/java/com/firebase/ui/database) all use this pattern. They build from a common FirebaseArray class (https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/master/database/src/main/java/com/firebase/ui/database/FirebaseArray.java) that observes the database, and then have adapter classes to glue to array to the UI.

      "You don't need to specify a separate test database if you just want to load fixtures for your tests. Django will automatically create a separate blank test database (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/overview/#the-test-database) for testing. If you want to reuse some fixtures based on your development or production database, you can try to dump the database (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata), here is an example command for dumping data in yaml format. JSON format is also supported.: pip install pyyaml python manage.py dumpdata --format=yaml > /foo_app/fixtures/dump_file.yaml In your setting, you can add a list of fixture dir like: FIXTURE_DIRS = ('/foo_app/fixtures/',) In your testing scripts, you can specify which fixture file shall be used for a TestCase class, like the following: class FooAppTest(TestCase): \"\"\" Test class for getting Foo \"\"\" fixtures = ['dump_file.yaml'] After setting up like the above, your tests for that class will load the fixture file(with the users or other objects populated for testing). You can find more details about creating and loading fixtures in the documentation. (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/tools/#fixture-loading)\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to use fixtures that way, TransactionTestCase.fixtures needs to be set. 1 (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TransactionTestCase.fixtures) The magic to load fixtures happens in TransactionTestCase. This is makes it so that Test classes that subclasses TransactionTestCase e.g. django.test.TestCase also load up fixtures specified in the fixtures attribute. 2 (https://github.com/django/django/blob/2.1.5/django/test/testcases.py#L973) The current TestModels test class subclasses unitest.TestCase and therefore does nothing with the fixtures setup. 3 (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/testing/tools/#fixture-loading) from django.test import TestCase class TestModels(TestCase): fixtures = ['test_data.yaml',] Usually it is just fine to set the name for the fixture file and not the entire path to the fixture file. If you need to set a custom folder for fixtures to be discovered in, that can be specified by setting FIXTURE_DIRS 4 (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/#what-s-a-fixture)\n",

What is happening in your case is that there is no initial_data fixture (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/howto/initial-data/#automatically-loading-initial-data-fixtures), which is the one that gets loaded when you run syncdb/migrate. The fixture to load must be specified in the fixtures attribute of the testcase (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/testing/tools/#topics-testing-fixtures) you run in the second command.\n",

      "As the saying goes, if it works don't fix it. Fixtures is the more usual method but no harm in using your own. If you were writing a new test case, you might want to use fixtures, but If I were you I would just let this be. If you want a fully automated way of achieving the result, consider migration.RunPython (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/migration-operations/#runpython). The linked document contains a full example which shows data being loaded. Obviously this will happen with ./manage.py migrate without the need of an additional step. The advantage of using migrations.RunPython is that if you were to share your app with a colleague or install on a different server, the required data will automatically be loaded into the production server and the tests will also have full access to it in the test database.\n",

      "Django automatically creates and drops a test database for you. Unless otherwise specified (we'll see how to in a second) this will be test_ + <the name of the database in the settings file>. So if your settings uses database foo, the tests will be executed against test_foo. No configuration changes are needed for this. If you wish to execute tests against a custom database (rather than test_foo) you can do that by tweaking the TEST_NAME setting (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std%3asetting-TEST_NAME). You can add TEST_NAME to each dictionary in DATABASES.\n",

So your project structure should look something like this: - Project-Root/ - Your-Non-App-Code/ - __init__.py - non_app_code.py - tests/ - __init__.py - non_app_code_tests.py For more info on how to install django-nose, check their Github repo: https://github.com/django-nose/django-nose (https://github.com/django-nose/django-nose)\n",

      "The source of initial fixtures for the `manage.py test` command in Django is typically either manually created YAML or JSON files stored in the `fixtures/` directory of each application in your `INSTALLED_APPS`, or they can be generated using the `dumpdata` management command.

      "To substitute a file within an AAR archive created by Axis2, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Extract the AAR file**: Since AAR is essentially a ZIP file with a different extension, you can extract its contents using a ZIP utility or a programming approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Using Java**: You can use the `ZipInputStream` and `ZipOutputStream` classes in Java to read and write ZIP files. The provided Java snippet in the context demonstrates how to update a single file within a ZIP file. You can adapt this code to target the specific file within the AAR archive you wish to modify.\n",
      "   - **Using a Graphical Tool**: Tools like WinRAR, 7-Zip, or even built-in Windows Explorer can be used to extract the AAR file, modify the desired file, and then repackage it as a ZIP file before renaming it to `.aar`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Replace the File**: Once you've accessed the internal structure of the AAR file, locate the file you want to replace and perform the substitution. Ensure that the replacement maintains the original file's structure and permissions if applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Repackage the AAR File**: After updating the necessary files, you'll need to recreate the AAR file by compressing the modified contents back into a ZIP archive. Again, you can use Java, a graphical tool, or command-line utilities for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rename Back to AAR Extension**: Finally, rename the newly formed ZIP file back to `.aar` to maintain compatibility with Android's dependency management tools like Gradle.\n",

      "A small performance bump may be to change iterrows() to itertuples, as described here: https://medium.com/swlh/why-pandas-itertuples-is-faster-than-iterrows-and-how-to-make-it-even-faster-bc50c0edd30d (https://medium.com/swlh/why-pandas-itertuples-is-faster-than-iterrows-and-how-to-make-it-even-faster-bc50c0edd30d) . Otherwise, if the code in the for-loop where you generate each row is computationally heavy, you may want to look into multiprocessing (https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html (https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html)). Something along the lines of: from multiprocessing import Pool from os import cpu_count with Pool(cpu_count()) as pool: pool.map(func, list(df.itertuples())) Where func is the function your applying to generate the row from the original row.\n",
      "\n",
      "When using itertuples() (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.itertuples.html), the index is included as part of the tuple, so the for index, value in grouped.itertuples(): doesn't really make sense. In fact, itertuples() uses namedtuple (https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) with Index being one of the names. Consider the following setup: data = {'A': list('aabbc'), 'B': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], 'C': list('vwxyz'), 'D': range(5,10)} df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index(['A', 'B']) Yielding the following DataFrame: C D A B a 0 v 5 1 w 6 b 0 x 7 1 y 8 c 0 z 9 Then printing each tuple in df.itertuples() yields: Pandas(Index=('a', 0), C='v', D=5) Pandas(Index=('a', 1), C='w', D=6) Pandas(Index=('b', 0), C='x', D=7) Pandas(Index=('b', 1), C='y', D=8) Pandas(Index=('c', 0), C='z', D=9) So, what you'll probably want to do is something like the code below, with value being replaced by t[1:]: for t in grouped.itertuples(): for i, key in enumerate(t.Index): ... If you want to access components of the namedtuple, you can access things positionally, or by name. So, in the case of your DataFrame, t[1] and t.firstname should be equivalent. Just remember that t[0] is the index, so your first column starts at 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, iterrows should only be used in very, very specific cases. This is the general order of precedence for performance of various operations: vectorization using a custom Cython routine apply reductions that can be performed in Cython iteration in Python space itertuples iterrows updating an empty frame (e.g., using loc one-row-at-a-time) Using a custom Cython routine is usually too complicated, so let's skip that for now. Vectorization is always, always the first and best choice. However, there is a small set of cases (usually involving a recurrence) which cannot be vectorized in obvious ways. Furthermore, on a smallish DataFrame, it may be faster to use other methods. apply usually can be handled by an iterator in Cython space. This is handled internally by pandas, though it depends on what is going on inside the apply expression. For example, df.apply(lambda x: np.sum(x)) will be executed pretty swiftly, though of course, df.sum(1) is even better. However something like df.apply(lambda x: x['b'] + 1) will be executed in Python space, and consequently is much slower. itertuples does not box the data into a Series. It just returns the data in the form of tuples. iterrows does box the data into a Series. Unless you really need this, use another method. Updating an empty frame a-single-row-at-a-time. I have seen this method used WAY too much. It is by far the slowest. It is probably common place (and reasonably fast for some Python structures), but a DataFrame does a fair number of checks on indexing, so this will always be very slow to update a row at a time. Much better to create new structures and concat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, the answer is the performance benefit of using iterrows. This post (https://engineering.upside.com/a-beginners-guide-to-optimizing-pandas-code-for-speed-c09ef2c6a4d6) could better explain the differences between the various options.\n",
      "\n",
      "A DataFrame is primarily a column-based data structure. Under the hood, the data inside the DataFrame is stored in blocks. Roughly speaking there is one block for each dtype. Each column has one dtype. So accessing a column can be done by selecting the appropriate column from a single block. In contrast, selecting a single row requires selecting the appropriate row from each block and then forming a new Series and copying the data from each block's row into the Series. Thus, iterating through rows of a DataFrame is (under the hood) not as natural a process as iterating through columns. If you need to iterate through the rows, you still can, however, by calling df.iterrows(). You should avoid using df.iterrows if possible for the same reason why it's unnatural -- it requires copying which makes the process slower than iterating through columns.\n",

      "pd.DataFrame.itertuples (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.itertuples.html) returns an iterable of namedtuples including the index by default. There are two options to account for this. Option 1 Unpack 3 items instead of 2, the first of which you do not use. Here is a minimal example: df = pd.DataFrame([[10, 20], [30, 40], [50, 60]], columns=['A', 'B']) for idx, a, b in df.itertuples(): print(idx, a, b) 0 10 20 1 30 40 2 50 60 In your case, a good convention to use would be to indicate an unused variable by _: for _, file_date, file_name in process_list[['date', 'name']].itertuples(): # do something Option 2 Use index=False argument and unpack 2 elements: for file_date, file_name in process_list[['date', 'name']].itertuples(index=False): # do something The behaviour is indicated in the documentation (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.itertuples.html): DataFrame.itertuples(index=True, name='Pandas') Iterate over DataFrame rows as namedtuples, with index value as first element of the tuple.\n",

      "A little timing suggest that the list comprehension is slightly faster than the itertools version (for short lists - Hackaholic's answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/27766329/3001761) suggests the reverse is true for long lists): >>> import timeit >>> timeit.timeit(\"[item for sublist in a for item in sublist]\", setup=\"import itertools; a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]\") 1.7200839519500732 >>> timeit.timeit(\"list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(a))\", setup=\"import itertools; a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]\") 2.0097079277038574 The key advantage of the iterative method comes if you can avoid building the whole list, iterating over chain.from_iterable's output rather than passing it to the list constructor. If you are doing operations on arrays and performance is a key consideration, consider using numpy, which, although not part of the standard library, is much faster (once you have the array): >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]) >>> a array([[ 1, 2], [ 3, 4], [ 5, 6], [ 7, 8], [ 9, 10]]) >>> a.ravel() array([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) >>> timeit.timeit(\"a.ravel()\", setup=\"import numpy as np; a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]])\") 0.36390113830566406\n",

      "Iterating over df.iterrows() is really slow because for each row it creates a separate pd.Series object. For 100 million rows this means 100 million such objects are being created (and discarded). It's better to zip the columns and use this in a comprehension like so: df.assign(d=[a[b:c] for a, b, c in zip(df['a'], df['b'], df['c'])]) This will only create three Series objects and then iterate over them which saves a lot of overhead. You can also take a look at Numba (https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/pysupported.html#str) to write your own function that loops over the data frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; No, for loops are not blanket \"bad\", at least, not always. It is probably more accurate to say that some vectorized operations are slower than iterating, versus saying that iteration is faster than some vectorized operations. Knowing when and why is key to getting the most performance out of your code. In a nutshell, these are the situations where it is worth considering an alternative to vectorized pandas functions: When your data is small (...depending on what you're doing), When dealing with object/mixed dtypes When using the str/regex accessor functions Let's examine these situations individually. Iteration v/s Vectorization on Small Data Pandas follows a \"Convention Over Configuration\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) approach in its API design. This means that the same API has been fitted to cater to a broad range of data and use cases. When a pandas function is called, the following things (among others) must internally be handled by the function, to ensure working Index/axis alignment Handling mixed datatypes Handling missing data Almost every function will have to deal with these to varying extents, and this presents an overhead. The overhead is less for numeric functions (for example, Series.add (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.23.4/pandas/core/ops.py#L1371-L1388)), while it is more pronounced for string functions (for example, Series.str.replace (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.23.4/pandas/core/strings.py#L635-L669)). for (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements) loops, on the other hand, are faster then you think. What's even better is list comprehensions (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) (which create lists through for loops) are even faster as they are optimized iterative mechanisms for list creation. List comprehensions follow the pattern [f(x) for x in seq] Where seq is a pandas series or DataFrame column. Or, when operating over multiple columns, [f(x, y) for x, y in zip(seq1, seq2)] Where seq1 and seq2 are columns. Numeric Comparison Consider a simple boolean indexing operation. The list comprehension method has been timed against Series.ne (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.ne.html) (!=) and query (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.query.html). Here are the functions: # Boolean indexing with Numeric value comparison. df[df.A != df.B] # vectorized != df.query('A != B') # query (numexpr) df[[x != y for x, y in zip(df.A, df.B)]] # list comp For simplicity, I have used the perfplot (https://github.com/nschloe/perfplot) package to run all the timeit tests in this post. The timings for the operations above are below: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/sbtDB.png) The list comprehension outperforms query for moderately sized N, and even outperforms the vectorized not equals comparison for tiny N. Unfortunately, the list comprehension scales linearly, so it does not offer much performance gain for larger N. Note It is worth mentioning that much of the benefit of list comprehension come from not having to worry about the index alignment, but this means that if your code is dependent on indexing alignment, this will break. In some cases, vectorised operations over the underlying NumPy arrays can be considered as bringing in the \"best of both worlds\", allowing for vectorisation without all the unneeded overhead of the pandas functions. This means that you can rewrite the operation above as df[df.A.values != df.B.values] Which outperforms both the pandas and list comprehension equivalents: NumPy vectorization is out of the scope of this post, but it is definitely worth considering, if performance matters. Value Counts Taking another example - this time, with another vanilla python construct that is faster than a for loop - collections.Counter (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter). A common requirement is to compute the value counts and return the result as a dictionary. This is done with value_counts (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.value_counts.html#pandas-series-value-counts), np.unique (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.1/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html), and Counter: # Value Counts comparison. ser.value_counts(sort=False).to_dict() # value_counts dict(zip(*np.unique(ser, return_counts=True))) # np.unique Counter(ser) # Counter (https://i.stack.imgur.com/2i5qT.png) The results are more pronounced, Counter wins out over both vectorized methods for a larger range of small N (~3500). Note More trivia (courtesy @user2357112). The Counter is implemented with a C accelerator (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.0/Modules/_collectionsmodule.c#L2249-L2354), so while it still has to work with python objects instead of the underlying C datatypes, it is still faster than a for loop. Python power! Of course, the take away from here is that the performance depends on your data and use case. The point of these examples is to convince you not to rule out these solutions as legitimate options. If these still don't give you the performance you need, there is always cython (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/enhancingperf.html#cython-writing-c-extensions-for-pandas) and numba (http://numba.pydata.org/). Let's add this test into the mix. from numba import njit, prange @njit(parallel=True) def get_mask(x, y): result = [False] * len(x) for i in prange(len(x)): result[i] = x[i] != y[i] return np.array(result) df[get_mask(df.A.values, df.B.values)] # numba (https://i.stack.imgur.com/nSpCH.png) Numba offers JIT compilation of loopy python code to very powerful vectorized code. Understanding how to make numba work involves a learning curve. Operations with Mixed/object dtypes String-based Comparison Revisiting the filtering example from the first section, what if the columns being compared are strings? Consider the same 3 functions above, but with the input DataFrame cast to string. # Boolean indexing with string value comparison. df[df.A != df.B] # vectorized != df.query('A != B') # query (numexpr) df[[x != y for x, y in zip(df.A, df.B)]] # list comp (https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lg2CE.png) So, what changed? The thing to note here is that string operations are inherently difficult to vectorize. Pandas treats strings as objects, and all operations on objects fall back to a slow, loopy implementation. Now, because this loopy implementation is surrounded by all the overhead mentioned above, there is a constant magnitude difference between these solutions, even though they scale the same. When it comes to operations on mutable/complex objects, there is no comparison. List comprehension outperforms all operations involving dicts and lists. Accessing Dictionary Value(s) by Key Here are timings for two operations that extract a value from a column of dictionaries: map and the list comprehension. The setup is in the Appendix, under the heading \"Code Snippets\". # Dictionary value extraction. ser.map(operator.itemgetter('value')) # map pd.Series([x.get('value') for x in ser]) # list comprehension (https://i.stack.imgur.com/QrbZO.png) Positional List Indexing Timings for 3 operations that extract the 0th element from a list of columns (handling exceptions), map (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.map.html#pandas-series-map), str.get accessor method (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.get.html), and the list comprehension: # List positional indexing. def get_0th(lst): try: return lst[0] # Handle empty lists and NaNs gracefully. except (IndexError, TypeError): return np.nan ser.map(get_0th) # map ser.str[0] # str accessor pd.Series([x[0] if len(x) > 0 else np.nan for x in ser]) # list comp pd.Series([get_0th(x) for x in ser]) # list comp safe Note If the index matters, you would want to do: pd.Series([...], index=ser.index) When reconstructing the series. (https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zzzez.png) List Flattening A final example is flattening lists. This is another common problem, and demonstrates just how powerful pure python is here. # Nested list flattening. pd.DataFrame(ser.tolist()).stack().reset_index(drop=True) # stack pd.Series(list(chain.from_iterable(ser.tolist()))) # itertools.chain pd.Series([y for x in ser for y in x]) # nested list comp (https://i.stack.imgur.com/eJ2iB.png) Both itertools.chain.from_iterable (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable) and the nested list comprehension are pure python constructs, and scale much better than the stack solution. These timings are a strong indication of the fact that pandas is not equipped to work with mixed dtypes, and that you should probably refrain from using it to do so. Wherever possible, data should be present as scalar values (ints/floats/strings) in separate columns. Lastly, the applicability of these solutions depend widely on your data. So, the best thing to do would be to test these operations on your data before deciding what to go with. Notice how I have not timed apply (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.apply.html#pandas-series-apply) on these solutions, because it would skew the graph (yes, it's that slow). Regex Operations, and .str Accessor Methods Pandas can apply regex operations such as str.contains (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.contains.html), str.extract (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.extract.html), and str.extractall (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.extractall.html#pandas.Series.str.extractall), as well as other \"vectorized\" string operations (such as str.split, str.find, str.translate, and so on) on string columns. These functions are slower than list comprehensions, and are meant to be more convenience functions than anything else. It is usually much faster to pre-compile a regex pattern and iterate over your data with re.compile (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.compile) (also see Is it worth using Python's re.compile? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452104/is-it-worth-using-pythons-re-compile)). The list comp equivalent to str.contains looks something like this: p = re.compile(...) ser2 = pd.Series([x for x in ser if p.search(x)]) Or, ser2 = ser[[bool(p.search(x)) for x in ser]] If you need to handle NaNs, you can do something like ser[[bool(p.search(x)) if pd.notnull(x) else False for x in ser]] The list comp equivalent to str.extract (without groups) will look something like: df['col2'] = [p.search(x).group(0) for x in df['col']] If you need to handle no-matches and NaNs, you can use a custom function (still faster!): def matcher(x): m = p.search(str(x)) if m: return m.group(0) return np.nan df['col2'] = [matcher(x) for x in df['col']] The matcher function is very extensible. It can be fitted to return a list for each capture group, as needed. Just extract query the group or groups attribute of the matcher object. For str.extractall, change p.search to p.findall. String Extraction Consider a simple filtering operation. The idea is to extract 4 digits if it is preceded by an upper case letter. # Extracting strings. p = re.compile(r'(?<=[A-Z])(\\d{4})') def matcher(x): m = p.search(x) if m: return m.group(0) return np.nan ser.str.extract(r'(?<=[A-Z])(\\d{4})', expand=False) # str.extract pd.Series([matcher(x) for x in ser]) # list comprehension (https://i.stack.imgur.com/XmXyX.png) More Examples Full disclosure - I am the author (in part or whole) of these posts listed below. Fast punctuation removal with pandas (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50444346/fast-punctuation-removal-with-pandas) String concatenation of two pandas columns (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11858472/string-concatenation-of-two-pandas-columns/54298586#54298586) Remove unwanted parts from strings in a column (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13682044/remove-unwanted-parts-from-strings-in-a-column/54302517#54302517) Replace all but the last occurrence of a character in a dataframe (https://stackoverflow.com/a/47813144/4909087) Conclusion As shown from the examples above, iteration shines when working with small rows of DataFrames, mixed datatypes, and regular expressions. The speedup you get depends on your data and your problem, so your mileage may vary. The best thing to do is to carefully run tests and see if the payout is worth the effort. The \"vectorized\" functions shine in their simplicity and readability, so if performance is not critical, you should definitely prefer those. Another side note, certain string operations deal with constraints that favour the use of NumPy. Here are two examples where careful NumPy vectorization outperforms python: Create new column with incremental values in a faster and efficient way - Answer by Divakar (https://stackoverflow.com/a/49471005/4909087) Fast punctuation removal with pandas - Answer by Paul Panzer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/50518852/4909087) Additionally, sometimes just operating on the underlying arrays via .values as opposed to on the Series or DataFrames can offer a healthy enough speedup for most usual scenarios (see the Note in the Numeric Comparison section above). So, for example df[df.A.values != df.B.values] would show instant performance boosts over df[df.A != df.B]. Using .values may not be appropriate in every situation, but it is a useful hack to know. As mentioned above, it's up to you to decide whether these solutions are worth the trouble of implementing.

      "The choice between using a for loop or `itertuples()` in pandas for data manipulation largely depends on the specific use case and the nature of the task at hand. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Performance**: Generally, pandas provides highly optimized functions for data manipulation, and these should be preferred whenever possible due to their efficiency. Vectorized operations are the fastest, followed by methods like `apply()`, and then `itertuples()`. However, there are specific cases where using a for loop or `itertuples()` might offer better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Memory Efficiency**: Iterating over rows using `itertuples()` is more memory-efficient than using `iterrows()`, as `itertuples()` returns a namedtuple containing the row data directly, whereas `iterrows()` returns a separate Series object for each row.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Accessing Components**: When using `itertuples()`, the data is returned as a namedtuple, making it easier to access individual columns or index components by name or position. With a for loop, you have more control over accessing and manipulating the data, but you need to manage the index and column names manually.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multiprocessing**: If your data manipulation task is computationally intensive, you can use multiprocessing to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores. In this case, you can use `Pool.map()` with a custom function that processes each row generated by `itertuples()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of using `itertuples()` with multiprocessing:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from multiprocessing import Pool\n",
      "from os import cpu_count\n",
      "\n",
      "def process_row(row):\n",
      "    # Your processing logic here\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "\n",
      "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
      "    with Pool(cpu_count()) as pool:\n",
      "        pool.map(process_row, df.itertuples())\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoiding `iterrows()`**: Due to its overhead in creating a separate Series object for each row, `iterrows()` should generally be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Instead, consider using vectorized operations, `apply()`, or `itertuples()` for better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Small Datasets**: For smaller datasets, the performance benefits of vectorized operations may diminish, and a for loop or `itertuples()` might offer comparable or even better performance. In such cases, benchmarking your\n",

      "Step 1. Get rid of your threads, you don't need, in fact, thread's in Swing a dangerous and need to be treated very carefully Step 2. You're thinking in to a linear fashion, this is not how GUIs work, GUIs are event driven, that is, something might happen in the future and you need to respond to it accordingly For example, let's assume p is a JButton, you might have them declared as instance fields within your class... private JButton p; private JTextField tf; Then when you initialise the UI (probably in the constructor), you would set up p and register it's ActionListener.... p = new JButton(\"Go\"); p.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"Hello\"); ne.remove(p); ne.revalidate(); ne.repaint(); System.out.println(\"why\" + EventQueue.isDispatchThread()); b = false; System.out.println(b); } }); p.setEnabled(false); Setting p disabled will prevent the user from clicking it. This is good for two reasons, one it prevents the ActionListener from been triggered, but also, it sends a clear message to the user that they can't click this button. As far as I know, currently your button could be clicked, but perform no action...kind of frustrating to the user Then you set up the text field... tf = new JTextField(20); tf.getDocument().addDocumentListener(new DocumentListener() { protected void update() { p.setEnabled(tf.getText().trim().length() > 0); } @Override public void insertUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { update(); } @Override public void removeUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { update(); } @Override public void changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { update(); } }); The DocumentListener in this case allows you to monitor for changes to the text fields state in real time and update the state of the button accordingly...\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to effect the state of the button based on changes which have occurred on the text fields, then those actions need to take place in the action handlers themselves (ie, the DocumentListeners) The following is a very basic example, which disables the \"action\" button until both the user name and password fields are no longer empty import java.awt.EventQueue; import java.awt.GridBagConstraints; import java.awt.GridBagLayout; import javax.swing.JButton; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JPanel; import javax.swing.JPasswordField; import javax.swing.JTextField; import javax.swing.UIManager; import javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException; import javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent; import javax.swing.event.DocumentListener; public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { new Test(); } public Test() { EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { try { UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()); } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"Testing\"); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.add(new TestPane()); frame.pack(); frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null); frame.setVisible(true); } }); } public class TestPane extends JPanel { private JTextField userNameField; private JPasswordField passwordField; private JButton actionButton; public TestPane() { userNameField = new JTextField(15); passwordField = new JPasswordField(15); actionButton = new JButton(\"Do stuff\"); actionButton.setEnabled(false); DocumentListener documentListener = new DocumentListener() { protected void stateDidChange() { actionButton.setEnabled(userNameField.getText().length() > 0 && passwordField.getPassword().length > 0); } @Override public void insertUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { stateDidChange(); } @Override public void removeUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { stateDidChange(); } @Override public void changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { stateDidChange(); } }; userNameField.getDocument().addDocumentListener(documentListener); passwordField.getDocument().addDocumentListener(documentListener); setLayout(new GridBagLayout()); GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints(); gbc.gridwidth = gbc.REMAINDER; add(userNameField, gbc); add(passwordField, gbc); add(actionButton, gbc); } } } Why is the initial state not been updated? You define a as.... int a; which gives it a initial (or default) value of 0. You then use... if(a == 2) { if (bEntrar.isEnabled() == false) { bEntrar.setEnabled(true); } }else{ if (bEntrar.isEnabled() == true) { bEntrar.setEnabled(false); } } to change the initial state. Since a is 0, the else block is executed, the only condition which would change the button enabled state to false would be if the current enabled state is true But when I use Shift+F6 to run the code it doesn't work Do a \"clean and build\" and run the project, not the file. In testing your code, the UI appears with the button already disabled\n",

      "Did you remember to call the function to hide the buttons within the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)?

      "It doesn't really have to do with disabling the button, but rather accessing the reference to the button at all. You need to declare the letterButton as final. That is, change from JButton letterButton = new ... to this final JButton letterButton = new ... Here is a good explanation on why it needs to be final: Why inner class can access only final variable? (http://technologiquepanorama.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/why-inner-class-can-access-only-final-variable/) The reason is basically the following: Your local variables can not be touched by other threads. The code of the ActionListener will possibly be executed by another thread. By making the variable final, you're basically transforming it to a value. This value can then be read by several threads concurrently.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is because in second case jButton1ActionPerformed() method is invoked on event dispatching thread (EDT) and you block this thread for a second. If EDT is blocked, UI is not updated. If you want the text to change after a second, you should not block EDT, but use some backgroung thred, e.g.: private void jButton1ActionPerformed( java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt ){ jTextField1.setText( \"Hello\" ); new javax.swing.SwingWorker< Void, Void >() { @Override protected Void doInBackground() throws Exception { Thread.sleep( 1000 ); } @Override protected void done() { jTextField1.setText( \"Hello2\" ); } }.execute(); } And do not use active waiting (while (c > a - 1000)). Use Thread.sleep() instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you disable a JButton with setEnabled(false), its registered ActionListener (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/event/ActionListener.html)s will not be called when you click on the button. However if you added a MouseListener (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/event/MouseListener.html) to it with addMouseListener() method, even if the button is disabled, the registered MouseListener will still be called. You should register an ActionListener to do the job that is required when the button is pressed/clicked. That way if you disable the button, the ActionListener will not be called if the button is clicked. See the following example: if you click on the button, it will only print \"clicked\" but it will not print \"action performed\". JFrame f = new JFrame(); f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); JButton b = new JButton(\"Test\"); b.setEnabled(false); b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"action performed\"); } }); b.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() { @Override public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { System.out.println(\"clicked\"); } }); f.add(b); f.pack(); f.setVisible(true); If you remove the b.setEnabled(false); line and you click on the button output will be : clicked action performed\n",
      "\n",
      "You have an infinite loop. The state of the toggle button is never changed after being set to true. Java's UI (and all UI I've worked with) is driven by a single thread. User input is fed back to you on this single thread. Rendering is also done on this single thread. The reason the textfield is never updated is the UI thread is never getting to render the screen again, as its tied up in your infinite loop. Yes, you need to put this code in a separate thread, and start it when the toggle button becomes selected. Then, you need to update the textfield from this separate thread.

      "mytask() //it taskes almost 30 minutes Your long running task to should execute on a separate Thread. If you invoke the long running task in the ActionListener then the GUI will freeze until the task finishes executing. Read the section from the Swing tutorial on Concurrency (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html) for more information. You will probably want to use a SwingWorker for the task. I added the below code in the button actionPerformed function.It doesn't disable/make it non editable If you already invoke the task in a separate Thread, then it means you don't have a reference to the text field that you add the frame. Maybe you created two instances.\n",

      "To problem solve you need to either: use a debugger to step through the code add System.out.println(...) statement to your code Either of the above will help you understand the logic flow to see if it is what you expect. I don't use an IDE so I made the following changes to add some debug code: private void actionButtonActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) { System.out.println(\"action\"); and private void inputTxtKeyTyped(java.awt.event.KeyEvent evt) { System.out.println(\"hide\"); If you make these changes and type data in your text field and use the Enter key you will see output like: hide hide hide hide action hide Why does this happen? Well, it would appear that the Enter key generates a KeyTyped event and this event is processed AFTER the ActionEvent One way to fix this is to wrap the logic that makes the label visible in a SwingUtilities.invokeLater(...). This will cause the code to be added to the end of the Event Queue so it will be executed after the event generated by the Enter key: //labelCopied.setVisible(true); SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { labelCopied.setVisible(true); } });\n",

      "Please provide your best answer below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "To address the provided code snippets and context, here are the answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Finding a View by ID and Setting Click Listener:**\n",
      "   - Both methods shown are correct for finding a view by ID and setting a click listener. However, the second method using `final` keyword for the `Button` object is generally preferred as it ensures that the reference cannot be changed after initialization, reducing potential bugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   findViewById(R.id.note).setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n",
      "       @Override\n",
      "       public void onClick(View v) {\n",
      "           startActivity(new Intent(LaunchActivity.this, CreateNote.class));\n",
      "       }\n",
      "   });\n",
      "\n",
      "   final Button buttonNote = (Button) findViewById(R.id.note);\n",
      "   buttonNote.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n",
      "       @Override\n",
      "       public void onClick(View v) {\n",
      "           startActivity(new Intent(LaunchActivity.this, CreateNote.class));\n",
      "       }\n",
      "   });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Storing and Passing Note IDs:**\n",
      "   - Storing and passing note IDs is crucial for editing existing notes. Using the note's position in a list can serve as an ID. Ensure you pass the note ID correctly when starting the `CreateNoteActivity`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   if (CreateNoteActivity.didClick) {\n",
      "       Note anote = notes.getItem(passedNoteId);\n",
      "       anote.setTitle(passedTitle);\n",
      "       anote.setDescription(passedDescription);\n",
      "   } else {\n",
      "       notes.add(new Note(passedTitle, passedDescription));\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Changing TextView to EditText:**\n",
      "   - Changing `<TextView>` to `<EditText>` allows users to input text directly within the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```xml\n",
      "   <EditText android:id=\"@+id/noteText\"... />\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Passing Extra Data in Intents:**\n",
      "   - When using `Intent`, ensure to include the necessary extra data (like keys and text) to avoid `NullPointerException`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, NoteEditorActivity.class);\n",
      "   intent.putExtra(\"key\", \"my key\");\n",
      "   intent.putExtra(\"text\", \"my text\");\n",
      "   startActivity(intent);\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dynamically Adding Views:**\n",
      "   - To dynamically add views (like `TextView`) based on user interaction, declare them as class members and initialize them inside the click listener.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "$() (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) is for wrapping DOM elements. You can use $.each() (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/) for iterating arrays and objects. $.each(obj, function(i, prop) { tr.append('<td>'+ i +'</td>' + '<td>'+ prop +'</td>'); });\n",
      "\n",
      "You can try using the the following function for a cleaner code var tbody = $('#dynamictable tbody'); for(var prop in dict){ if(dict.hasOwnProperty(prop)){ var tr = $('<tr>'); $('<td>').html(prop).appendTo(tr); $('<td>').html(dict[prop]).appendTo(tr); tbody.append(tr); } } Please check the link to a working Fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/HectorBarbossa/FunvZ/218/) here.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are appending the string, not the jQuery object. var $ele = $('<td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td><td></td>'); $ele.find('td:last').append('<button>MyButton</button>'); $('#myTable tbody').append($ele); // or $ele.appendTo('#myTable tbody'); UPDATE : The same behavior with one linear code using chaining. $('<td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td><td></td>').appendTo('#myTable tbody').find('td:last').append('<button>MyButton</button>');\n",
      "\n",
      "jQuery doesn't let you prepend \"html\". It lets you prepend DOM nodes, it just happens to have an API that lets you create them by passing HTML. Any HTML you pass it will be turned into complete elements. You need to work with a node tree, not pieces of HTML. i.e. var table = jQuery('<table>'); var row = jQuery('<tr>'); var cell = jQuery('<td>'); row.append(cell); table.append(row); container.append(table); Alternatively, build all your HTML in a string before appending it. var html = '<table>'; html += '<tr>'; html += '<td>'; html += '</td>'; html += '</tr>'; html += '</table>'; container.append(html);\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't use .append() to append partial pieces of HTML. .append() only appends whole formed objects and when it appends them it appends them as the last child of the target object. To add to that, some browsers are picking about how you can or cannot create/remove content in tables. Assuming #storeTable is the <table> tag, you could assign .html() to create a whole new table all at once: $(\"#storeTable\").html(\"<tr><td>\" + returnData[\"1\"][\"ID\"] + \"</td></tr>\"); Working demo: http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/5BVdX/ (http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/5BVdX/)\n",

      "\n",
      "When you use jQuery selector, it returns JQuery object, which has it's own append() function - documented here (https://api.jquery.com/append/). When you use native browser selector, return object is of type Element, which has it's own append() function, behaving slightly differently and documented here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append). So for the Element.append() you have to spread the array, like this: myElement.append(...myArray); Otherwize, if array is passed without spread, it's threated as a single item and is converted to string internally, using myArray.toString(). Markup of your table becomes: <table id=\"removeTest2\"> [object HTMLTableRowElement],[object HTMLTableRowElement],[object HTMLTableRowElement],[object HTMLTableRowElement] </table> If you use spread syntax (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), you'll get correct result (table with table rows): const trElements = document.querySelector(\"#removeTest\").tBodies[0].children const trArray = Array.from(trElements) const newOne = document.querySelector(\"#removeTest2\"); newOne.append(...trArray) #removeTest { position: relative; border: 2px solid blue; height: 100px; width:300px; } #removeTest2 { position: relative; border: 2px solid red; height: 100px; width:300px; } <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js\"></script> <table id=\"removeTest\"> <tr> <td>test1</td> <td>test1</td> <td>test1</td> <td>test1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test2</td> <td>test2</td> <td>test2</td> <td>test2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test3</td> <td>test3</td> <td>test3</td> <td>test3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>test4</td> <td>test4</td> <td>test4</td> <td>test4</td> </tr> </table> <table id=\"removeTest2\"> </table>\n",

      "\n",
      "When you face an error, typically, the program will halt. That's why there are error handlers (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) in place to not let that happen. Look at some already answered examples here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/4592193/15459230) So, lets say you want the user to input integer values and it shouldn't halt, so you could use a loop and break it when the entered value is an integer (there's no error thrown) ... while True: try: i = int(input(\"Integer: \")) break except: print(\"Error\") ... You get the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm guessing that you want your program to continue asking for a number when the user's input it not a number. If this is the case, which you should clarify, then this will do the trick: except: print(\"It has to be a whole number\") continue The continue keyword skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration. The continue keyword in Python (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_continue.asp) Without doing this your code will print \"Must be a number\" in your exception, but will continue execution at the next line where you try to convert number, which at this point we know can't be converted to an int, thereby causing an unhandled exception. This will be solved by using the continue keyword as I suggested. However, if there was no exception raised (i.e. the input can be interpreted as an int), than there is absolutely no point in saying int(number) as number at this point is already an int!\n",
      "\n",
      "What I believe is considered the most Pythonic way in these cases is wrap the line where you might get the exception in a try/catch (or try/except) and show a proper message if you get a ValueError exception: print (\"Welcome to August's decimal to binary converter.\") while True: try: value = int(input(\"Please enter enter a positive integer to be converted to binary.\")) except ValueError: print(\"Please, enter a valid number\") # Now here, you could do a sys.exit(1), or return... The way this code currently # works is that it will continue asking the user for numbers continue Another option you have (but is much slower than handling the exception) is, instead of converting to int immediatly, checking whether the input string is a number using the str.isdigit() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit) method of the strings and skip the loop (using the continue (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement) if it's not. while True: value = input(\"Please enter enter a positive integer to be converted to binary.\") if not value.isdigit(): print(\"Please, enter a valid number\") continue value = int(value)\n",
      "\n",
      "What you're looking for is the try-except block. See the following for an example: input_invalid = true while input_invalid: user_input = input(\"Enter position: \") try: user_input = int(user_input) input_invalid = false except ValueError: print(\"Please enter a valid integer!\") Here, the try-except block catches any errors (of the type specified in except) thrown within the code block. In this case, the error results from trying to call int() on a string that does not contain an integer (ValueError). You can use this to explicitly prevent the error and control the logic flow of your program like shown above. An alternate solution without using try-except is to use the .isdigit() method to validate the data beforehand. If you were to use .isdigit() (which I personally think is better), your code would look something like this: input_invalid = true while input_invalid: user_input = input(\"Enter position: \") if user_input.isdigit(): input_invalid = false else: print(\"Please enter a valid integer!\") Hope this helped!\n",

      "To handle unexpected numeric input leading to syntax errors, you can use Python's try-except block for exception handling. This allows you to catch exceptions gracefully without halting the entire program. Here's how you can implement it:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while True:\n",

      "print(f\"The number you entered is: {number}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this code snippet, the `try` block attempts to convert the user's input into an integer. If the conversion fails due to a `ValueError`, the `except` block catches the exception and prints an appropriate error message. The loop continues, prompting the user to re-enter their input until a valid integer is provided. Once a valid integer is entered, the `break` statement exits the loop, allowing your program to proceed with the rest of its operations.\n",
      "\n",

      ".apply (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) is used to call a function with an array of arguments. It takes each element in the array, and uses each as a parameter to the function. .apply can also change the context (this) inside a function. So, let's take $.when. It's used to say \"when all these promises are resolved... do something\". It takes an infinite (variable) number of parameters. In your case, you have an array of promises; you don't know how many parameters you're passing to $.when. Passing the array itself to $.when wouldn't work, because it expects its parameters to be promises, not an array. That's where .apply comes in. It takes the array, and calls $.when with each element as a parameter (and makes sure the this is set to jQuery/$), so then it all works :-)\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The unexpected behavior of `$.when.apply` might stem from several potential issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Usage**: The most common reason for unexpected behavior is incorrect usage of `.apply`. Remember that `.apply(thisArg, argsArray)` expects `argsArray` to be an array-like object or an actual Array instance containing the arguments to be passed to the target function. If you pass a non-array-like object or a plain object without using `Array.prototype.slice.call()`, you may encounter issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example of correct usage:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   var promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3]; // An array of promises\n",
      "   $.when.apply($, promises); // Correct usage\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example of incorrect usage:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   var promises = {0: promise1, 1: promise2, 2: promise3}; // A plain object\n",
      "   $.when.apply($, promises); // Incorrect usage\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Order of Arguments**: Although `$.when` accepts an arbitrary number of promises, the order of arguments matters. Ensure that the promises are provided in the desired execution sequence when calling `$.when.apply`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   var promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];\n",
      "   $.when.apply($, promises.reverse()); // This will execute promises in reverse order\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Context Issue**: As mentioned earlier, `.apply` changes the `this` value within the target function. For `$.when`, this should generally be `$` (jQuery). However, if there's any other context assigned to `$` before invoking `$.when.apply`, it might lead to unexpected results.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   var someObject = {};\n",
      "   $.when.apply(someObject, [promise1, promise2]); // Incorrect context\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Uncaught Promise Rejections**: If one or more promises in the array are rejected, the `.then()` chain won't be executed unless explicitly handled with `.catch()`. Make sure to handle rejections properly by adding `.catch()` to the final `.when()` chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   $.when(promise1, promise2)\n",
      "    .done(function() {\n",
      "       console.log('Both promises resolved');\n",
      "     })\n",
      "    .fail(function(error) {\n",
      "       console.log('One or more promises were rejected', error);\n",

      "Let’s try to tackle the problem together: You probably do know how to get the maximum value of a non-nested iterable (being it a list, tuple, or whatever). You can use the built-in max() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) function, or alternatively write your own if you may not use a built-in function for your task. We’ll assume for now that we have a max function (self-written or not) that accepts a non-nested iterable and returns the maximum, e.g: >>> max([2, 1, 5]) 5 >>> max((7, 7, 5)) 7 So we know how to solve this for the easiest case: non-nested iterables. Now let’s go one level up: We have an iterable of iterables, for example this: lst = [[2, 1, 5], [4, 2]] How do we get the maximum here? We first get the maximum for each sublist and then get the maximum of all calculated maximums. Something like this: maximums = [] for sublist in lst: maximums.append(max(sublist)) print(max(maximums)) # 5 So far so good. Now let’s assume that our list lst also contains single numbers, so it’s an uneven list: lst = [[2, 1, 5], 8, [4, 2], 2] So when we loop through the items of the list, we need to either just take the number or calculate the maximum for the sublist: maximums = [] for item in lst: if isinstance(item, int): # item is a number itself, so it’s the maximum of itself maximums.append(item) else: maximums.append(max(sublist)) print(max(maximums)) # 8 So now we have the ability to max an iterable that contains mixed values. Now what we need to do is make sure that this works for any level of nestedness. For this purpose, we use recursion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion): We start at the outermost list and iterate through its items. When the item is a number, we can just keep the number. When its an iterable, we calculate its maximum using our solution. Afterwards we get the maximum of all collected maximums: def nested_max(iterable): maximums = [] for item in iterable: if isinstance(item, int): # still nothing to do with simple numbers maximums.append(item) else: # we encountered an iterable but we do not know how deep it is; so instead of # using the simple `max` function, we use our `nested_max` function recursively maximums.append(nested_max(item)) # maximums only contains numbers, so we can use the normal `max` here return max(maximums) And that’s it! Let’s give it a try: >>> nested_max((5, (1,2), [[1],[2]])) 5 >>> nested_max(([[2, 1, 5], [4, 2], 6], ([2, 1], (7, 7, 5), 6))) 7 >>> nested_max(((4,), (2,), (6, 2), (3, 6, 2))) 6 >>> nested_max([[[[[[6]]]]]]) 6\n",

This code makes no assumptions about the number of digits.

That will return a string that will show, well, degrees, minutes, and seconds. This function will start with the coordinate and truncate it. This value, in positive, is your amount of degrees. The decimal portion needs to be converted to minutes. We take what's left from that rounding and we multiply it by 60. We apply the same logic to get the seconds: so we use only the truncated number for our string but we keep the non-truncated to get the decimal part. Finally, we check if the original value of the coordinate was positive or negative. For latitude, positive (or zero) is North, otherwise South. For longitude, positive (or zero) is East, otherwise, West.\n",

      "By \"Decimal coordinates\" do you mean latitude and longitude (also known as the decimal degree)? If so, what you're trying to do is pretty easy: Given a DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) coordinate such as W87°43′41″, it's trivial to convert it to a number of decimal degrees using the following method: Calculate the total number of seconds, 43′41″ = (43*60 + 41) = 2621 seconds. The fractional part is total number of seconds divided by 3600. 2621 / 3600 = ~0.728056 Add fractional degrees to whole degrees to produce the final result: 87 + 0.728056 = 87.728056 Since it is a West longitude coordinate, negate the result.

Building on Converting latitude and longitude to decimal values (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1140189/converting-latitude-and-longitude-to-decimal-values), we can easily make a specific conversion utility that should fit your case: var input = \"N44°49'43.15 / W000°42'55.24''\"; function parseDMS(input) { var halves = input.split('/'); // Separate northing from easting. return { // Ready to be fed into Leaflet. lat: parseDMSsingle(halves[0].trim()), lng: parseDMSsingle(halves[1].trim()) }; } function parseDMSsingle(input) { var direction = input[0]; // First char is direction (N, E, S or W). input = input.substr(1); var parts = input.split(/[^\\d\\w.]+/); // 0: degrees, 1: minutes, 2: seconds; each can have decimals. return convertDMSToDD( parseFloat(parts[0]) || 0, // Accept missing value. parseFloat(parts[1]) || 0, parseFloat(parts[2]) || 0, direction ); } function convertDMSToDD(degrees, minutes, seconds, direction) { var dd = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/(60*60); if (direction == \"S\" || direction == \"W\") { dd = dd * -1; } // Don't do anything for N or E return dd; } console.log(input); console.log(parseDMS(input));\n",

The answer involves mathematical concepts such as ellipsoids and great circles. But given that you're working with Javascript and Leaflet, I'll just jump to practical implementations. If you need a super-accurate answer, you want to have a look at the JS implementation of GeographicLib (http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/js/), and its methods to solve the direct geodesic problem. If you don't really care about accuracy (and specially do not care about accuracy at the poles), you want to have a look at cheap-ruler (https://github.com/mapbox/cheap-ruler), and specifically its destination(p, dist, bearing) method. There are more solutions, like using a equidistant map projection centered on the point, or some other implementations of the geodesic problems, or some turf.js (http://turfjs.org/) trickery, or creating the geometries outside of JS with similar methods, or whatever.

      "The issue you're facing revolves around properly integrating a dropdown child component within a parent component using React-Hook-Forms while ensuring that the `ref` isn't passed as a prop and that submission retains the correct values. To address these concerns, consider the following approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a custom Dropdown component** (as you already did), ensuring that it accepts necessary props, such as `input`, `label`, and `people`. Inside the component, maintain the state to store the selected value.\n",

      "     value={selectedValue}\n",

      "     setFormElementValue('dropDownSelect', newValue);\n",
      "   };\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "   ```jsx\n",
      "   const renderSelectOptions = (options) =>\n",
      "     options.map((option) => (\n",

      "     </select>\n",
      "   );\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Finally, pass the `handleDropdownChange` function and the initial state (`selectedValue`) to the Dropdown component:\n",

      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can create your own annotations and apply them to your own classes. If you specify that an annotation is detectable at runtime, you can process it easily with reflection. For example, you could use something like this to print the name of each field in a class that has been marked with the Funky annotation: for (Field someField : AnnotatedClass.getClass().getDeclaredFields()) { if (someField.isAnnotationPresent(Funky.class)) { System.out.println(\"This field is funky: \" + someField.getName()); } } The code to declare the Funky annotation would look something like this: package org.foo.annotations; @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.FIELD) public @interface Funky { } Here's a class that uses the annotation: package org.foo.examples; import org.foo.annotations.Funky; public class AnnotatedClass { @Funky private String funkyString; private String nonFunkyString; @Funky private Integer funkyInteger; private Integer nonFunkyInteger; } Here's some more reading on Annotations (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/language/annotations.html). Here are the javadocs for the classes used above: Retention annotation (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Retention.html) RetentionPolicy enum (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html) Target annotation (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Target.html) Field class (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Field.html) isAnnotationPresent() method (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/AccessibleObject.html#isAnnotationPresent%28java.lang.Class%29) getDeclaredFields() method (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getDeclaredFields%28%29) I'm trying to understand your car example, but I'm not sure I follow what you want. If you had a list of objects (Jaguar, Porche, Ferrari, Kia) that extend Car and are marked with various car-related annotations, you could create an object that filters the list based on annotations. The code might look like this: @WorldsFinestMotorCar class Jaguar extends Car { // blah blah } @BoringCar class Porche extends Car { // blah blah } @BoringCar class Ferrari extends Car { // blah blah } @IncredibleCar class Kia extends Car { // blah blah } You could implement an AnnotationFilter class that removes cars from the list that do not have a certain annotation. It might look something like this: List<Car> carList = getListOfRandomCars(); AnnotationFilter<Car> annoFilter = new AnnotationFilter<Car>(BoringCar.class); List<Car> boringCars = annoFilter.filter(carList); Is that what you want to do? If so, it can definitely be done. The implementation for AnnotationFilter might look something like this: public class AnnotationFilter<T> { private Class filterAnno; public AnnotationFilter(Class a) { filterAnno = a; } public List<T> filter(List<T> inputList) { if (inputList == null || inputList.isEmpty()) { return inputList; } List<T> filteredList = new ArrayList<T>(); for (T someT : inputList) { if (someT.getClass().isAnnotationPresent(filterAnno)) { filteredList.add(someT); } } return filteredList; } } If that's not what you're after, a specific example would be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The annotation shows up within the generics part. This immediately means two things: If the type is in a place that isn't part of a signature (so, a local variable declaration, or a cast, or the X in new Foo<X>(), etc - then it is just gone, generics are erased in such circumstances. There is simply no way to refer to it, you can't see it anymore at runtime. If the type is part of a signature (it is the type of a field, the return type of a method, the type of a parameter, or something you extends or implements), then it is retained at runtime, but, all the usual methods to get this stuff, such as someJLReflectFieldInstance.getType(), always return a java.lang.Class instance, and generics is eliminated from these as well, so you can't use these methods. If you're in boat #1, the answer is immediately over: impossible. If you're in boat #2, this is possible. First, find the getGenericType() method - a variant method that also returns the type you want, but as a Type and not as a Class. For j.l.reflect.Field, that method is getGenericType(). Similar methods exist for method return types, parameter types, etcetera. Then realize this still isn't enough - that gets you the stuff in the <>, but strips out all annotations. Keep looking and you find the true winner. For j.l.r.Field, that is getAnnotatedType. You now have an AnnotatedType, which seems almost entirely useless: It has virtually no methods. It's a catch-all marker-esque interface, because there are really different ideas on what types are in java. ? is a type in this sense, because it can show up in a place types show up: List<?>. So is ? extends Map<?, Set<String>>. So is T, and so is String, and so is int[], and so double. And they can almost all be annotated. The usual solution is casting and instanceof checks. Something like List<@NonNull String> is a java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedParameterizedType. So let's cast and continue with that. This interface has the getAnnotatedActualTypeArguments() method, which returns an array of that useless AnnotatedType again: Appropriate; after all, it could be List<?>, List<String>, List<T>, List<? extends Stuff>, etcetera. @NonNull String would be an instanceof java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedType. Let's put it all together. Toss this in a file, compile it, and run it: import java.lang.annotation.*; import java.util.List; import java.lang.reflect.*; @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE) @interface NonNull {} class Test { List<@NonNull String> example; public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { Field f = Test.class.getDeclaredField(\"example\"); AnnotatedParameterizedType listType = (AnnotatedParameterizedType) f.getAnnotatedType(); AnnotatedType annType = (AnnotatedType) listType.getAnnotatedActualTypeArguments()[0]; for (Annotation ann : annType.getAnnotations()) { System.out.println(\"Annotation found: \" + ann); } } } javac Test.java; java Test > Annotation found: @NonNull() NB: If you know what you are looking for, the above isn't so bad, but if you're trying to process a wide array (heh) of possible type kinds, you soon run into a gigantic soupy mess of code. I'm not directly aware of libraries to help out, but you may want to look into it or write something; it's not too difficult to set up a visitor pattern for this stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure what your use case is, so I have two answers: Answer 1: If you just want to write as little code as possible, here is my suggestion extending Dunes' answer: public enum ImplicitType { DO_NOT_USE; } @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.FIELD) public @interface MyAnnotation { Class<? extends Enum<?>> clazz() default ImplicitType.class; String value(); } @MyAnnotation(\"A\"); private MyEnumType myEnumField; When clazz is ImplicitType.class, use the fields type as enum class. Answer 2: If you want to do some framework magic and want to maintain compiler checked type safety, you can do something like this: /** Marks annotation types that provide MyRelevantData */ @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE) public @interface MyAnnotation { } And in the client code, you would have /** Provides MyRelevantData for TheFramework */ @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.FIELD) @MyAnnotation public @interface MyEnumAnnotation { MyEnumType value(); // default MyEnumType.FOO; } @MyEnumAnnotation(MyEnum.FOO) private MyEnumType myValue; In this case you would scan the field for annotations which again are annotated with MyAnnotation. You will have to access the value via reflection on the annotation object, though. Seems like this approach is more complex on the framework side.\n",
      "\n",
      "With RUNTIME generation, that's pretty simple @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.FIELD) @interface Set { int value(); } class Injector { public static void inject(Object instance) { Field[] fields = instance.getClass().getDeclaredFields(); for (Field field : fields) { if (field.isAnnotationPresent(Set.class)) { Set set = field.getAnnotation(Set.class); field.setAccessible(true); // should work on private fields try { field.set(instance, set.value()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } } } class Demo { @Set(1) public int var; public int var2; public void call(){ Injector.inject(this); System.out.println(var); System.out.println(var2); } } public class AnnotationDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { new Demo().call(); } } When you run that it prints 1 0 It's iterating over the declared fields (i.e. all fields where the declaration is in this class, If you want this to work with inherited fields from super classes you'd have to scan for those as well) Checks each field for the annotation and if found sets the field to the value present in the annotation. When you want to do the same with a CLASS or the simpler SOURCE (class is odd (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5971234/retentionpolicy-class-vs-runtime) and I would use either source or runtime) annotation you'd have to implement a special annotation processor (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/AbstractProcessor.html) class that is called by the java compiler when compiling .java files that contain annotations you're interested in. In the next step you would generate a .java text source file that contains the code that does the injection. That code is then also compiled by the compiler and your Injector class at runtime would simply call the generated code. So all you need to do is to manage to write a class .java file like class GeneratedInjector { public static void inject(Object instance) { if (instance instanceof Demo) { injectDemo((Demo) instance); } } public static void injectDemo(Demo demo) { demo.var = 1; } } at compile time based on analysis of annotations. So at runtime, the annotation is essentially not present and the code that runs is basically the following class GeneratedInjector { public static void inject(Object instance) { if (instance instanceof Demo) { injectDemo((Demo) instance); } } public static void injectDemo(Demo demo) { demo.var = 1; } } class Injector { public static void inject(Object instance) { GeneratedInjector.inject(instance); } } class Demo { public int var; public int var2; public void call(){ Injector.inject(this); System.out.println(var); System.out.println(var2); } } public class AnnotationDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { new Demo().call(); } } Since that's all straight forward plain old Java and not reflection you save some CPU cycles. It's most likely not noticeable in most cases but lots of reflection can have an impact. https://deors.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/annotation-generators/ (https://deors.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/annotation-generators/) has some more nice information There is also a third hybrid approach and that is bytecode generation at runtime. With that you would generate a .class file that implements roughly the same as the .java file. Needs a bytecode framework like https://github.com/cglib/cglib (https://github.com/cglib/cglib). That approach is also not easily compatible with Android since you need to generate .dex for Android. But I think I've seen even that somewhere.\n",

      "Its not so hard to create such an effect using jQuery. Create a single element vor every character, move it somewhere and then animate it back to original position. A simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/dNXVx/ (http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/dNXVx/)\n",
      "\n",
      "You could try using CSS animations and transitions instead a JavaScript library/plugin or marquee (that as mentioned on the comments, it is obsolete and should be avoided (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html#the-marquee-element-0)). One example of how it could be done with CSS and animations: * { margin:0; padding:0; border:0; } @keyframes slide { from { left: 100%;} to { left: -100%;} } @-webkit-keyframes slide { from { left: 100%;} to { left: -100%;} } #marquee { color:red; background:#f0f0f0; width:100%; height:120px; line-height:120px; overflow:hidden; position:relative; } #text { position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:120px; font-size:30px; animation-name: slide; animation-duration: 10s; animation-timing-function: linear; animation-iteration-count: infinite; -webkit-animation-name: slide; -webkit-animation-duration: 10s; -webkit-animation-timing-function:linear; -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite; } <div id=\"marquee\"> <div id=\"text\">Your Text</div> </div> You can adjust the speed of the marquee by changing the value of the animation-duration. And you should modify the value of the to depending on the length of text. Update after comment from Jay (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32638465/how-to-scroll-text-smoothly-using-html5/32639529#comment85745569_32639529): the marquee failed when the text was larger than the space of the marquee. One solution would be to make blank space not wrap/break and animations that take into account the size of the text (using transforms and not only position to move the text): * { margin:0; padding:0; border:0; } @keyframes slide { from { left:100%; transform: translate(0, 0); } to { left: -100%; transform: translate(-100%, 0); } } @-webkit-keyframes slide { from { left:100%; transform: translate(0, 0); } to { left: -100%; transform: translate(-100%, 0); } } .marquee { color:red; background:#f0f0f0; width:100%; height:120px; line-height:120px; overflow:hidden; position:relative; } .text { position:absolute; top:0; white-space: nowrap; height:120px; font-size:30px; animation-name: slide; animation-duration: 30s; animation-timing-function: linear; animation-iteration-count: infinite; -webkit-animation-name: slide; -webkit-animation-duration: 30s; -webkit-animation-timing-function:linear; -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite; } <p>Text Fits</p> <div class=\"marquee\"> <div class=\"text\">Text Here</div> </div> <p>Text overflows</p> <div class=\"marquee\"> <div class=\"text\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam eget sem non lacus condimentum dictum quis id tortor.</div> </div> Then the movement is a bit choppy on my browser. I will look for a more smooth solution, but this would fix the text length issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you do it with CSS or JavaScript, you (or some library) are going to have to put each letter in its own element in order to animate them individually. E.g.: <p>Hi there</p> ...will need to become <p><span>H</span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>h</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>e</span></p> That leads me to think a JavaScript solution might be preferred, as otherwise your markup will be a bit...unpleasant to write. With JavaScript using jQuery, it's quite easy to replace the text of an element with a bunch of spans containing that text character-by-character: var target = $(\"#target\"); target.html(target.text().replace(/./g, \"<span>$&</span>\")); Then you animate the spans. (Note I'm assuming here that the element in question contains only text, not text and child elements. It's more complex if you have child elements.) Here's a very basic example: HTML: <p id=\"target\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">Hi there</p> JavaScript: jQuery(function($) { var target = $(\"#target\"); target.html(target.text().replace(/./g, \"<span>$&</span>\")); setTimeout(runAnimation, 250); function runAnimation() { var index, spans; index = 0; spans = target.children(); doOne(); function doOne() { var span = $(spans[index]); if (!$.trim(span.text())) { // Skip blanks next(); return; } // Do this one span.css({ position: \"relative\", }).animate({ top: \"-20\" }, \"fast\").animate({ top: \"0\" }, \"fast\", function() { span.css(\"position\", \"\"); next(); }); } function next() { ++index; if (index < spans.length) { doOne(); } else { setTimeout(runAnimation, 500); } } } }); Live copy (http://jsbin.com/ifoyay) | source (http://jsbin.com/ifoyay/edit)\n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on exactly what you want to do. If you just want to fade-in the text all at once (or some other animation), css3 is probably sufficient to handle this. If you're trying to display the text letter-by-letter (as you'd find in an RPG, for example), then you'll need code to iterate over the string and write it one letter at a time. Here's an example of this in javascript, taken directly from this (https://stackoverflow.com/a/7265613/3456453) answer to a similar question: var showText = function (target, message, index, interval) { if (index < message.length) { $(target).append(message[index++]); setTimeout(function () { showText(target, message, index, interval); }, interval); } } Essentially, the code looks at each index of the data passed into it (t, then h, then e) for instance, and writes it to your target one letter at a time. Please see the linked answer for additional details. Here is a good link on CSS3 Animations (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation). Additionally, jQuery (http://api.jquery.com/) has some great functions for a number of animations that go beyond what CSS can do on its own, if you don't mind using a plugin. As an aside, you should keep in mind browser compatibility when you're trying to perform animations like this. Older browsers likely will have spotty or no support for this kind of thing, so you should have a fall-back. EDIT: Sorry to add another link, but here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/29170639/3456453) is a good implementation on displaying one word at a time. This code is taken directly from the linked answer, with my explanation added: var textToDisplay = \"Even more awesome text inside here, but displayed one word at a time\", $output = $(\"p\"); $(\"button\").click(function() { var displayInt; textToDisplay = textToDisplay.split(' '); //split the text variable into an array $output.empty(); //clear out the $output variable displayInt = setInterval(function() { var word = textToDisplay.shift(); //removes the first word (\"Even\") and sets the word variable to that value if (word == null) { return clearInterval(displayInt); } //if we're out of words to append $output.append(word + ' '); //else, add the word and then a space (.split(' ') will not carry over the spaces) }, 300); //setInterval is delayed 300ms, so a word will be added every 300ms }); Note this method and the one I added previously both use jQuery (the $ symbol is a jQuery prefix).

How to achieve an animation: Select all the text rows with JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript?retiredLocale=de) and precisely modify the DOM using innerHTML (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML?retiredLocale=de). You need to receive random characters and precisely modify the DOM in order to achieve a planned out animation. Animation: Set an interval to call your DOM modification function and add some logic to craft a more complex animation. Example: Here is a simple example that I have created, the animation consists of 1 row and we shift the content to the left and right.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have received the answer from KIE dev team lead: \"The cache is for the .class compilations. It still needs the DRL to build the rules and wire the pre-compiled .class files. It’s done this way as in general the parser and rule builders not too intensive, but .class generation is.\" https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/drools-usage/XqzfBvpdjSg (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/drools-usage/XqzfBvpdjSg) Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please provide your best answer below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "The necessity of source `.drl` files for a cached Drools KIE base lies in the fact that the cache is primarily used for storing compiled `.class` files generated from these source files during the rule compilation process. The cache itself does not store the actual rule definitions; it merely retains the compiled bytecode for faster access on subsequent runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During runtime, when a cached KIE base is loaded, Drools first checks if the corresponding `.class` file exists in the cache. If it does, the system retrieves the compiled class directly from the cache instead of recompiling the `.drl` file. This significantly improves performance by avoiding the overhead of parsing and compiling the DRL rules each time the application starts or the KIE base is reused.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, having the original `.drl` files is essential because they contain the actual rule definitions written in Drools Rule Language (DRL). These files serve as the input for the compiler, which generates the corresponding `.class` files stored in the cache. Without the `.drl` files, there would be no rules to compile, and thus, no compiled classes to be cached.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while caching helps optimize runtime performance by bypassing the compilation step, the presence of source `.drl` files is necessary for the initial compilation of rules into `.class` files and maintaining the ability to modify or update the rules without losing the cached compiled versions.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use toMap instead of groupingBy, and BinaryOperator instead of Collectors.maxBy, like: public Map<Integer, StudentGrade> getMaxGradeByStudent(List<StudentGrade> grades) { return grades.stream() .collect(Collectors.toMap(StudentGrade::getStudentId, x -> x, // Or Function.identity(), BinaryOperator.maxBy(Comparator.comparing(StudentGrade::getValue)))); }\n",
      "\n",
      "In functional terms, what you want is to group each list value by their first element and select only the maximum value with regard to the second element. Using the Stream API, you can: Use the groupingBy(classifier, downstream) (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#groupingBy-java.util.function.Function-java.util.stream.Collector-) collector to group by the list by their first element. The downstream collector applied to all values classified to the same key is maxBy(comparator) (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#maxBy-java.util.Comparator-) that selects only the maximum of the collected values. In this case, the comparator compares the second value of each list as an int with the help of the built-in comparingInt (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#comparingInt-java.util.function.ToIntFunction-). Since maxBy returns an Optional (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) in the case that no values were collected, we wrap it with a call to collectingAndThen(finisher) (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#collectingAndThen-java.util.stream.Collector-java.util.function.Function-) where the finisher retrieves the Optional value (we know in this case that at least one value will have been classified) by calling Optional.get() (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html#get--). Finally, we keep only the values() (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#values--) from the resulting Map<String, List<String>> and, since this returns a Collection<List<String>>, we create an ArrayList based on it. Sample code: List<List<String>> maxValues = new ArrayList<>( data.stream() .collect(Collectors.groupingBy( l -> l.get(0), Collectors.collectingAndThen( Collectors.maxBy(Comparator.comparingInt(l -> Integer.parseInt(l.get(1)))), Optional::get ) )) .values() ); which results in [1, 9, A, Aaa], [2, 5, B, Bbb], [3, 6, C, Ccc], [4, 10, D, Ddd], [5, 8, E, Eee]] for your sample data.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can get a single key via Integer max=mapGroup.entrySet().stream().max(Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).get().getKey(); but unfortunately, there is no built-in function for getting all equivalent maximums. The simplest, straight-forward solution is to find the maximum value first and retrieve all keys mapping to that value afterwards: private List<Integer> testStreamMap(Map<Integer, Long> mapGroup) { if(mapGroup.isEmpty()) return Collections.emptyList(); long max = mapGroup.values().stream().max(Comparator.naturalOrder()).get(); return mapGroup.entrySet().stream() .filter(e -> e.getValue() == max) .map(Map.Entry::getKey) .collect(Collectors.toList()); } Solutions for getting all maximum values of a stream in a single pass, are discussed in “How to force max() to return ALL maximum values in a Java Stream? (https://stackoverflow.com/q/29334404/2711488)”. You will see that single-pass solutions are much more complicated and not worth the effort if your input is an ordinary Map (e.g. HashMap), which can be iterated multiple times cheaply.\n",

      "I would group by value and store the values into a TreeMap in order to have my values sorted, then I would get the max value by getting the last entry as next: Stream.of(1, 3, 5, 3, 2, 3, 5) .collect(groupingBy(Function.identity(), TreeMap::new, toList())) .lastEntry() .getValue() .forEach(System.out::println); Output: 5 5\n",

For this, it uses an overload of Collectors.toMap (https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#toMap(java.util.function.Function,java.util.function.Function,java.util.function.BinaryOperator)) that requires 3 arguments: keyMapper: a Function that transforms elements of the stream to keys valueMapper: a Function that transforms elements of the stream to values mergeFunction: a BinaryOperator that is used to resolve collisions between values associated with the same key In this case, the Item::getEffect method reference is being used as the keyMapper function, which transforms an Item instance to its effect. Then, Function.identity() is being used as the valueMapper function, which does nothing, i.e. it leaves each Item instance untouched. Finally, BinaryOperator.maxBy(Comparator.comparingInt(i -> Integer.parseInt(i.getValue()))) is being used as the mergeFunction, which is a BinaryOperator that receives two values of the map that have the same key (i.e. two Item instances with the same effect), and resolves the collision in the map by selecting the Item instance that has the max value (value is first converted to Integer, so that we compare numeric values instead of strings).\n",

      "You are probably overriding the wrong method. What happens is that you are probably attempting to override a method in your abstract class but what you are actually doing is to just define a new method with a new name. In the interface, the method is named method but in your abstract class your method is named myMethod. So, check this out: public abstract class AbstractClass implements ISomeInterface{ // Not the same name as in the interface public void myMethod(){ //...here goes implemetations } } In order to solve it, simply change the method name in the subclass to the correct name. public abstract class AbstractClass implements ISomeInterface{ // Now you have the correct name and inheritance will // work as expected @Override public void method(){ //...here goes implemetations } } This is the perfect case for explaining the @Override annotation as well ;) When overriding a method, you might want to use the @Override annotation that instructs the compiler that you intend to override a method in the superclass. If, for some reason, the compiler detects that the method does not exist in one of the superclasses, then it will generate an error. When you declare a method with the annotation @Override the overridden method must match the signature of the interface-method (or superclass method). Read more about @Override in the Oracle Docs (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html). And, if you are not trying to override the method named method in your abstract class you simply need to add that method to your concrete class like this: public class ConcreteClass extends AbstractClass { // Now we are implementing the correct method from the interface // If not, there will be a compiler error. @Override public void method() { } //... } On a side note which may be relevant: methods can have the same name but with different argument lists. This is known as overloading (or overloaded methods) which you can read more about in this article (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html). Edit: Since the OP is using Java 5 this question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/987973/why-does-eclipse-complain-about-override-on-interface-methods) may be interesting. The @Override annotation changed between Java 5 and Java 6.

      "When overriding a method in an abstract class or implementing a method from an interface in Java, it's crucial to ensure that the method names, return types, and parameter lists match exactly. Here's how you can do it correctly:\n",

      "1. **Abstract Class Overriding**:\n",
      "    - Ensure the method name matches exactly with the method in the superclass.\n",
      "    - Use the `@Override` annotation to help catch errors during compilation if the method signature doesn't match.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    public abstract class AbstractClass {\n",
      "        protected void myMethod(int param) {\n",
      "            // implementation\n",
      "        }\n",

      "        public void myMethod() {\n",
      "            // implementation\n",

      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Interface Implementation**:\n",
      "    - Implement methods from interfaces by providing their exact signatures.\n",
      "    - Use the `@Override` annotation for the same purpose as above.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",

      "        void myMethod();\n",

      "    - For generic methods, ensure that the type parameters match those declared in the parent class or interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    public abstract class GenericAbstractClass<T> {\n",

      "4. **Compiler Warnings and Errors**:\n",
      "    - If you use `@Override` without a matching method in the superclass or interface, the compiler will throw an error.\n",
      "    - If the method signatures don't match, the compiler will also give warnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can effectively override methods in abstract classes and implement methods from interfaces in Java, including handling generic methods. Always use the `@Override` annotation to ensure method signatures align correctly and catch potential errors early through compile-time checks.\n",

      "Answering this question even though OP seems to figured out the answer, since he hasn't explained the underlying concepts. Firebase sdk uses async programming and observer pattern to provide real time updates. The right way to Asynchronous Firebase data get on React Native world be as follows. Initialize firebase sdk only once during application startup. In React terms this can be done inside the constructor of the top level App component. See firebase docs for the steps. https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start (https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) Inside component constructor or componentDidMount set up the call to firebase function to load data componentDidMount(){ this.loadMessagesFromFirebase(this.state.chatId); } In the load messages function at up async call to the firebase realtor database. More reading here https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write (https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write) The main thing to remember here is that all code that has to run after data is available has to be triggered from writing the async call back. Modifying the example code from the question loadMessagesFromFirebase(chatId){ let data = {}; let output = {}; const dataRef = firebase.database().ref('chats').child(chatId); dataRef.once('value', datasnap=>{ data = datasnap.val(); // Do something really smart with the data and assign it to output ...... output = data; // set updates to the state this.setState({output: output}); }) } Note the use of once instead of the on function. The reason for this is that for getting subscription to the observer on can lead to the callback being triggered every time there is a change in data. This can lead to undesirable consequences if the component was designed to only get data once. Further reading https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write (https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write) In case it is desirable to have the component updated every time there is a data change then use the on function to set up a subscription to that data. However in such a case it is important to cancel the subscription inside of componentWillUnmount https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.Reference#off (https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.Reference#off) This can be summarized as follows ` // inside componentDidMount this.onValueChange = ref.on('value', function(dataSnapshot) { ... }); // Sometime later.... Inside componentWillUnmount ref.off('value', this.onValueChange);`\n",

Firebase synchronizes the state of the (paths you observe in the) database, it does not just pass messages around about changes as they happen (as a message queue would do).

      "Answer: \n",
      "React Native is built on top of JavaScript, which is asynchronous by nature. When working with Firebase, it's crucial to understand how to handle asynchronous operations properly. The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that you're using the 'once()' method instead of 'on()' for setting up a listener for real-time updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'once()' method reads the current value of a specific location in the database and removes the listener afterwards. This means that subsequent writes to the same location won't trigger the listener. On the other hand, 'on()' sets up a persistent listener that continues to respond to changes at a given location in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your case, you probably want to use 'on()' to listen for real-time updates. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "import firebase from'react-native-firebase';\n",
      "\n",
      "// Assuming you've initialized Firebase correctly\n",

Whenever there's a change in the data at 'chats/' + this.props.chatId, the listener will fire, updating the component's state accordingly. Remember to unsubscribe from the listener in 'componentWillUnmount' to avoid memory leaks.\n",

Instead, I suggest you create a \"fake group\" (https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-filter-the-data-before-its-charted).

      "First off, whenever possible, I would suggest using the built-in selection/filter state rather than trying to keep track of clicks yourself. Otherwise they are bound to get out of sync at some point. If you have the boldness of the ticks driven by the active filters, then you'll get the same behavior whether the bar or the tick was clicked, and you can be certain that exactly the ticks in the filters are the bolded ones: CSS .dc-chart g.axis.x text.selected { font-weight: bold; } JS chart.on('filtered', function(chart) { var filters = chart.filters(); chart.selectAll('.axis.x .tick text').classed('selected', function(d) { return filters.includes(d); }) }) [Side note since I'm not answering your exact question: if you want to make your code work, you could do something like filter the selection based on d: ByTopLvl.select('.tick text').filter(function(d2) { return d2 === d; }) or in your case, this is the clicked tick, so d3.select(this) should also work. But I think you'll run into a lot of bugs that way.] Similarly, you can simplify your click behavior by tying into the built-in filter behavior, which already toggles: chart.on('pretransition', function(chart) { chart.select('.axis.x') .selectAll('.tick text') .on('click.select', function(d) { chart.filter(d); chart.redrawGroup(); }); }); Yeah, it's weird that the built-in filter function toggles, but that's just the way that dc.js evolved.

The filter selection is shared between the parent and child, except they sort also handle it separately. Unfortunately when I have to troubleshoot composite charts, I just try different things until it works, and never fully understand what's going on. I think it's just too complicated for my brain. :-O Anyway, this worked... Keep a reference to the inner bar chart: var chart = dc.compositeChart('#test'), bar; chart .width(768) .height(380) .x(d3.scaleBand()) .xUnits(dc.units.ordinal) .brushOn(false) .xAxisLabel('Fruit') .yAxisLabel('Quantity Sold') .dimension(fruitDimension) .group(sumGroup) ._rangeBandPadding(0.05) .compose([ bar = dc.barChart(chart) .barPadding(0.1) .outerPadding(0.05) ]) When responding to the click, filter the child bar chart instead of the parent: chart.on('pretransition', function(chart) { chart.select('.axis.x') .selectAll('.tick text') .on('click.select', function(d) { bar.filter(d); chart.redrawGroup(); }); }); Listen to the filtered event of the child bar chart and apply axis bolding to the parent composite chart: bar.on('filtered', function(chart) { var filters = chart.filters(); chart.selectAll('.axis.x .tick text').classed('selected', function(d) { return filters.includes(d); }) }) Whoo. I guess it's sorta.. consistent? The child bar chart is the source of truth for the filters. Maybe I'm rationalizing. New fiddle version. (https://jsfiddle.net/gordonwoodhull/z7mt4jvf/45/)\n",

Finally, to avoid stomping on the events used by dc.js internally, you may want to namespace your event handler. Adding it up, barChart.on('renderlet.barclicker', function(chart, filter) { chart.selectAll('rect.bar').on('click.custom', function(d) { // use the data in d to take the right action }); });\n",

      "To retrieve a variable from a dynamically loaded PHP include file, you can use global variables or pass the variable as a parameter to the included file. Here's how you can achieve this using both methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using Global Variables:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the main script where you include the dynamic file, set a global variable before including the file:\n",
      "```php\n",
      "<?php\n",

      "include('dynamic_file.php');\n",

      "```\n",
      "Then, in the `dynamic_file.php`, you can access the global variable:\n",
      "```php\n",
      "<?php\n",
      "global $my_var; // Declare the global variable\n",
      "echo $my_var;\n",
      "?>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Passing Variable as Parameter:\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can pass the variable as a parameter when including the dynamic file:\n",
      "```php\n",
      "<?php\n",
      "$my_var = 'Hello World';\n",
      "include('dynamic_file.php', $my_var);\n",
      "?>\n",

      "extract($_GET); // This will create local variables for all GET parameters\n",
      "echo $my_var;\n",
      "?>\n",
      "```\n",
      "Note that using `extract()` with GET parameters can lead to conflicts if there are other GET parameters present. To avoid this, you should specify the exact parameter you want to extract:\n",

However, since the cipher can handle any byte payload, I would remove the part that currently limits these functions to strings. I'd change them to expect and return bytes, and then either: call them as x = aes.encrypt(s.encode('utf8')) and s = aes.decrypt(x).decode('utf8'), respectively, or make wrapper functions for string handling. For encrypting files you can then directly do this: with open('some.txt', 'rb') as fp: encrypted = aes.encrypt(fp.read()) and this would not impose any encoding assumptions at all, but encrypt the bytes of the file as they are. AES is a block cipher, which means encrypt(a) + encrypt(b) is the same as encrypt(a + b). For encrypting files that's very useful, because you can read the file incrementally in chunks (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/519633/lazy-method-for-reading-big-file-in-python) of N * AES.block_size, with only the last chunk padded.

The AES instance contains internal buffers that cannot be easily refreshed. key = b'Sixteen byte key' # encryption iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size) cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv) msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn...') print (msg) print (base64.b64encode(msg)) # decryption cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, msg[:16]) print (cipher.decrypt(msg[16:])) However when it decrypts it has a bunch of /xxx/xxx/xxx/xxx/ in front of the decrypted string. You have much luck that you see the decrypted string at all at the end. This is only because the IV is prepended to the message and the inner workings of the CFB mode of operation.

      "PyCryptodome has a good documentation. The GCM example there (https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/cipher/modern.html#gcm-mode) uses JSON for concatenating/separating nonce, ciphertext, and tag, but the principle is the same and can easily be applied to your code. Since you are using the implicitly derived nonce, be aware that PyCryptodome applies a 16 bytes nonce. Note, however, that the recommendation for GCM is a 12 bytes nonce (s. here (https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/cipher/modern.html#gcm-mode), Note section). The following decryption example uses a key and ciphertext created with the code you posted for encryption: from Crypto.Cipher import AES HexMyKey = '6f9b706748f616fb0cf39d274638ee29813dbad675dd3d976e80bde4ccd7546a' HexEncryptedOriginalMessage = '6b855acc799213c987a0e3fc4ddfb7719c9b87fcf0a0d35e2e781609143b6e2d8e743cf4aea728002a9fc77ef834' key = bytes.fromhex(HexMyKey) data = bytes.fromhex(HexEncryptedOriginalMessage) cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, data[:16]) # nonce try: dec = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(data[16:-16], data[-16:]) # ciphertext, tag print(dec) # b'my secret data' except ValueError: print(\"Decryption failed\") If authentication fails, decrypt_and_verify() (https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/cipher/modern.html?highlight=decrypt_and_verify#decrypt_and_verify) generates a ValueError. PyCryptodome also allows for GCM decryption without prior authentication: cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, data[:16]) # nonce dec = cipher.decrypt(data[16:-16]) # ciphertext print(dec) # b'my secret data' However, this should not be done for GCM for security reasons, since a ciphertext is only trustworthy after successful authentication. Furthermore, the encryption and decryption codes are somewhat inconsistent in that the encryption uses scrypt as the key derivation function and the decryption uses the derived key directly. Normally, one would expect that the key is also derived during decryption. Possibly you take this shortcut only for testing purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "GCM is a stream cipher mode and therefore does not require padding. During encryption, an authentication tag is implicitly generated, which is used for authentication during decryption. Also, an IV/nonce of 12 bytes is recommended for GCM. The posted Python code unnecessarily pads and doesn't take the authentication tag into account, unlike the JavaScript code, which may be the main reason for the different ciphertexts. Whether this is the only reason and whether the JavaScript code implements GCM correctly, is difficult to say, since the getMessageEncoding() method was not posted, so testing this was not possible. Also, both codes apply a 16 bytes IV/nonce instead of the recommended 12 bytes IV/nonce. Cryptography offers two possible implementations for GCM. One implementation uses the architecture of the non-authenticating modes like CBC. The posted Python code applies this design, but does not take authentication into account and therefore implements GCM incompletely. A correct example for this design can be found here (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/symmetric-encryption/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM). Cryptography generally recommends the other approach for GCM (s. the Danger (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/symmetric-encryption/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM) note), namely the AESGCM (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/aead/?highlight=authenticated%20encryption#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESGCM) class, which performs implicit authentication so that this cannot be accidentally forgotten or incorrectly implemented. The following implementation uses the AESGCM class (and also takes into account the optional additional authenticated data): from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM import base64 #import os #key = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=256) #nonce = os.urandom(12) key = base64.b64decode('MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTIzNDU2Nzg5MDE=') # fix for testing, AES-256 nonce = base64.b64decode('MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAx') # fix for testing, 12 bytes plaintext = b'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' aad = b'the aad' # aad = None without additional authenticated data aesgcm = AESGCM(key) ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext, aad) print('Ciphertext (B64): ' + base64.b64encode(ciphertext).decode('utf8')) decrypted = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, aad) print('Decrypted: ' + decrypted.decode('utf8')) with the output: Output Ciphertext (B64): JOetStCANhPISvQ6G6IcRBauqbtC8fzRooblayHqkqSPKzLbidx/gBWfLNzBC+ZpcAGnGnHXaI7CB1U= Decrypted: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog The authentication tag is appended to the ciphertext, so the (Base64 decoded) result has the length of the plaintext (43 bytes) plus the length of the tag (16 bytes, default), giving a total of 59 bytes. For testing, a predefined key and IV/nonce are used with regard to a comparison with the result of the JavaScript code. Note that in practice a key/IV pair may only be used once for security reasons, which is especially important for GCM mode, e.g. here (https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/26790). Therefore a random IV/nonce is typically generated for each encryption. The WebCrypto API is a low level API for cryptography and does not provide methods for Base64 encoding/decoding. In the following, js-base64 (https://github.com/dankogai/js-base64#readme) is used for simplicity. Just like the Python code, the tag is appended to the ciphertext. A possible implementation for AES-GCM using the key and IV/nonce of the Python code that is functionally essentially the same as the posted JavaScript code is: (async () => { var key = Base64.toUint8Array('MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTIzNDU2Nzg5MDE='); // fix for testing, AES-256 var nonce = Base64.toUint8Array('MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAx'); // fix for testing, 12 bytes var plaintext = new TextEncoder().encode(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"); var aad = new TextEncoder().encode('the aad'); var keyImported = await await crypto.subtle.importKey( \"raw\", key, { name: \"AES-GCM\" }, true, [\"decrypt\", \"encrypt\"] ); var ciphertext = await await crypto.subtle.encrypt( { name: \"AES-GCM\", iv: nonce, additionalData: aad }, // { name: \"AES-GCM\", iv: nonce } without additional authenticated data keyImported, plaintext ); console.log('Ciphertext (Base64):\\n', Base64.fromUint8Array(new Uint8Array(ciphertext)).replace(/(.{48})/g,'$1\\n')); var decrypted = await await crypto.subtle.decrypt( { name: \"AES-GCM\", iv: nonce, additionalData: aad }, // { name: \"AES-GCM\", iv: nonce } without additional authenticated data keyImported, ciphertext ); console.log('Plaintext:\\n', new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted).replace(/(.{48})/g,'$1\\n')); })(); <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-base64@3.2.4/base64.min.js\"></script> with the output: Ciphertext (Base64): JOetStCANhPISvQ6G6IcRBauqbtC8fzRooblayHqkqSPKzLbidx/gBWfLNzBC+ZpcAGnGnHXaI7CB1U= Plaintext: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog where the ciphertext is the same as that of the Python code.\n",

      "Is it possible to reference a child class's member variable using a parent class reference?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can access it via self reference, because Child inherited var. Try this: class Parent: var = 222 class Child(Parent): def __init__(self): print(self.var) child = Child() print(child.var)\n",
      "\n",
      "In python, unlike in Java, a class serves more as a namespace than as an object. An inner class (in this case Parent.Child) is no different semantically than the same class defined as a standalone - the outer class is simply how it's accessed (and it's accessed statically, not requiring an instance - again unlike Java). If you want a Child to take its Parent's variables, you'll need to tell the Child explicitly which object is its Parent: class Parent: def __init__(self): self.x = 1 self.y = 2 class Child: def __init__(self, parent): self.parent = parent def parent_vars(self): att = self.parent.x print(att) par = Parent() child = Parent.Child(par) # note how `Parent.Child`, not `par.Child()` child.parent_vars() # 1\n",
      "\n",
      "If you inherit from the parent class all variables will be present in child classes. Use super init in the child to make sure the parent class instantiates. class Parent: def __init__(self): self.parent_var = 'ABCD' class Child(Parent): def __init__(self): super().__init__() child = Child() print(child.parent_var) prints: 'ABCD'\n",
      "\n",
      "You are mistaking instance variables with class variables. Here, you defined instance variables because the assignation is inside the __init__ (the initialization of the instance). What you want is to define a class variable, like so : class Parent: var1 = None class Child1(Parent): def __init__(self, var1): super().__init__() Parent.var1 = var1 class Child2(Parent): def __init__(self, var1): super().__init__() Parent.var1 = var1 child1 = Child1(1) child2 = Child2(2) print(child1.var1) # prints 2 !! <----- print(child2.var1) # prints 2 Before, each instance had its own var1 variable, that's what an instance variable is, by definition. But in my example, the var1 variable is defined into the class object. Each instance can reference it (using Parent.var1), but it is always the same variable. But Python is nice and lets you access class variable as if they were instance variables, which can cause confusion. But bear in mind that this is now what inheritance is designed for. Yes, you can use that way but it is a bit unuasual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you do something in a subclass that would eliminate it, then yes. Attributes assigned to Python objects are just added to the object's __dict__ (except for the relatively rare cases where slots is used or __setattr__ is overridden to do something non-standard), and the implicit first argument to a bound member method is going to be the same for methods originating from the child or the parent class. Vanilla instance attributes (though not methods or class attributes) are not bound in any way to a specific class definition, only to the object instance to which they belong. The one caveat to that statement is attributes with names beginning with double underscores. They'll still be added to the __dict__ and accessible, but they will have been name mangled, so will only be accessible outside the defining class if retrieved using the mangled transformation of the attribute name.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you have noted in the question, you can access the parent attribute by explicitly using the mangled form of its name in the child class: def ChildMethodWhichUsingParentField(self): return self._Parent__field This is the only simple answer to your direct question. However, if you have control over the Parent class, this would be a very bad design. You should not use a double-underscore attribute name for something that another class class will ever use (and really you probably shouldn't use it even if you don't expect any such use). Use a single underscore (_field) instead. This \"documents\" that the attribute is intended to be private (e.g. not part of a class's public API), without enabling name mangling. That way, if you find later than another class does need to access the variable it can. Python doesn't enforce privacy (not even when name mangling is used), so you'll always need to rely upon other code behaving nicely. Name mangling is really only intended for use in situations where you need to avoid name collisions. For instance, a proxy object might use mangled names for its own attributes so that it can present an interface that is an exact replica of another object's interface (which may not be known ahead of time). Or a mixin class might use name mangling for its variables since it can't know for sure what attribute names will be used in the (possibly many) other classes that will be inherited along side it. It can also be useful if you're adding an attribute for your own use to other objects (not self) and want to avoid overwriting their existing attributes by mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot. Python does not have class declarations. It has class definitions. When you define the Parent2 class, the indented code is executed. This means that any inner class defined there is created before the parent exists. Hence it is impossible to let Child2 know about Parent2 inside the class scope. Note that this is very different from other languages, such as Ruby that do allow references to the class inside the definition. Also note that your two examples do two very different things. If you put the class definition inside a method that a new class will be created every time you call the method, while doing so at the class scope means that only one class will be created inside the parent scope. Also I believe your design is broken. If Child is strictly related to Parent then you should either use inheritance, in which case you simply do self.getParentName(), without anything fancy, or you can use delegation. If you really want to do that thing, then you must somehow \"fix\" the classes after the parent class was defined. In order to do this you can use a class decorator, or simply put the code explicitly after the parent class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, just access the variable on the class object: class myClass(object): myvariable = 1 def add(self): myClass.myvariable += 1 def print1(self): print myClass.myvariable or if you want to set it per sub-class, use type(self): class myClass(object): myvariable = 1 def add(self): type(self).myvariable += 1 def print1(self): print type(self).myvariable The difference is that the latter will create a separate attribute on any subclass when set, masking the base class attribute. This is just like setting an attribute on an instance would mask the class attribute. Although you can get the class attribute via self as well (print self.myvariable), explicit is better than implicit here, and avoids accidentally being masked by an instance attribute of the same name. Setting class attributes always has to be done on the class; setting it on self would create or update an instance attribute instead (not shared). Do inherit your classes from object though; using new-style classes has many advantages, not in the least that type(self) will then actually return the class. In old-style classes (not inheriting from object) you'd have to use self.__class__ instead. Using object as a base also gives you a third option, class methods with the @classmethod decorator (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#classmethod); use these when you only need to access the class object, not the instance. These methods are bound to the current (sub)class, so their effect on class attributes is the same as using type(self): class myClass(object): myvariable = 1 @classmethod def add(cls): cls.myvariable += 1 @classmethod def print1(cls): print cls.myvariable\n",
      "\n",
      "You can refer to attributes of the class directly in the class definition, as long as the reference comes after the definition: class A: class B: pass x = B print(A.x) # <class '__main__.A.B'> This has some caveats. For reasons that are very complicated, (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13913933/6779307) you can't use class attributes directly in a comprehension in the class definition: class A: class B: pass x = [B for _ in range(5)] # NameError: name 'B' is not defined You also can't refer to the class itself in it's own definition: class A: x = A # NameError: name 'A' is not defined This is because class definition is basically another way of creating a type (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) object class A: x = 1 A = type('A', (object,), {'x': 1}) And it makes total sense both that you can't use an object before it's created and that you can't refer to it by a name it hasn't been assigned to yet. It's important to note that this all applies only to the class definition itself, that is to say all of the code that gets executed directly as the class is created. Code that gets executed later, like method definitions, can refer to the class like any other code or through type(self)\n",

The more efficient method would be to use the max() function with a key: max_index = max(range(len(l)), key=l.__getitem__) This will return the (first) index of the maximum value in list l; given a list of indices (range(len(l))), it'll find the index for which l.__getitem__() returns the highest value.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided method using `enumerate()` and a loop is indeed an effective way to find the index of the first maximum value in a list without using the built-in `max()` function. It works by initializing `max_index` to 0, then iterating through the list with `enumerate()`, comparing each value to the current maximum (`l[max_index]`). If a larger value is found, `max_index` is updated to the current index. By the end of the loop, `max_index` holds the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, as it requires a single pass through the elements. In terms of space complexity, it's O(1), since only a single additional variable (`max_index`) is used regardless of the input size.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the alternative method using `max()` with a key is generally considered more Pythonic and more readable. It also has a time complexity of O(n), but it might be slightly faster due to being implemented in C under the hood. Here's how you can use it:\n",

For this to work you have to modify the list elements at each index position, something like this: def to_str(item): # iterate over the indexes in the item for i in range(len(item)): # we can remove this check, and simply convert everything to str if not isinstance(item[i], str): item[i] = str(item[i]) return item Or we can create a new list with the results, instead of overwriting the original (but this will be equivalent to using a list comprehension, better use a list comprehension): def to_str(item): result = [] for element in item: # we can remove this check, and simply convert everything to str if not isinstance(element, str): result.append(str(element)) else: result.append(element) return result Also, regarding your second approach: it'd be better if you avoid using list, map and lambda, if what you want is to create a new list as a result use a list comprehension directly. This is a more idiomatic way to solve the problem, also removing the unnecessary string check: [[str(i) for i in item] for item in lst] => [['test1', '555'], ['test2', '3333']]\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "The issue with the original code is that it attempts to modify the list elements while iterating over them. In Python, it's generally not recommended to modify a list while iterating over it because it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the provided code snippet, the function `to_str` is trying to iterate over the list `lst` and convert each element to a string. However, the code inside the loop attempts to modify the list elements by converting non-string elements to strings. This modification happens while iterating over the list, which can cause issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this, there are two common approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Modify the list in place**: You can create a new list and append the converted elements to it. This avoids modifying the list while iterating over it. Here's how you can do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def to_str(item):\n",
      "    result = []\n",
      "    for element in item:\n",
      "        if not isinstance(element, str):\n",
      "            result.append(str(element))\n",
      "        else:\n",
      "            result.append(element)\n",
      "    return result\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "lst = [['test1', 555], ['test2', 3333]]\n",
      "converted_lst = [to_str(item) for item in lst]\n",
      "print(converted_lst)  # Output: [['test1', '555'], ['test2', '3333']]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use a list comprehension**: List comprehensions are a more concise and Pythonic way to achieve the same result. They allow you to create a new list based on the existing one without the need to explicitly handle the iteration and appending:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Using list comprehension\n",
      "converted_lst = [['str(i)' if not isinstance(i, str) else i for i in item] for item in lst]\n",
      "print(converted_lst)  # Output: [['test1', '555'], ['test2', '3333']]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Both approaches ensure that the list elements are converted to strings without modifying them during iteration, thus avoiding any unexpected behavior.\n",

      "This issue mainly happening because you are drawing multiple charts on the same canvas on calling the createChart() method.

This will clean up any references stored to the chart object within Chart.js, along with any associated event listeners attached by Chart.js. This must be called before the canvas is reused for a new chart. So, simply add a new data option to store current chart instance like: data(){ return{ chart: null } }, then store the chart instance like: createChart() { this.chart = new Chart(document.getElementById(\"chart\"), { ... and inside watch before calling this.createChart(); use: this.chart.destroy(); this.createChart(); Working Demo: Vue.component('chart', { template: '<canvas id=\"chart\"></canvas>', props: { savings: Object, }, data(){ return{ chart: null } }, watch: { savings: { deep: true, handler() { console.clear(); console.log('Update Chart'); this.chart.destroy(); this.createChart(); } } }, methods: { createChart() { this.chart = new Chart(document.getElementById(\"chart\"), { type: 'bar', data: { datasets: [{ label: 'Bar Dataset', data: [...this.savings.annual] }, { label: 'Line Dataset', data: [...this.savings.cumulative], type: 'line' }], labels: ['Year One', 'Year Two', 'Year Three', 'Year Four', 'Year Five'] } }); } }, mounted() { this.createChart(); //console.log(this.totals); } }); var app1 = new Vue({ el: '#savings_calculator', data: { savings: { annual: [123, 345, 234, 234, 523], cumulative: [234, 523, 234, 423, 100], } }, methods: { changeData() { for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { Vue.set(this.savings.annual, i, Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1)); Vue.set(this.savings.cumulative, i, Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1)); } } } }); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.3/Chart.bundle.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.5.17/vue.min.js\"></script> <div id=\"savings_calculator\"> <div class=\"input container\"> <button v-on:click=\"changeData\">Change Data</button> <chart v-bind:savings=\"savings\" /> </div> </div>\n",

      "The reason you do not see an alert when you click the generate button is because Vue has decided that nothing has really changed, so it doesn't need to update the DOM. As I was saying in the comments above, Vue DOM updates happen asynchronously, which means that Vue is not going to check to see if anything has changed until after your method is complete. When your method is complete, nothing in your state has really changed; you set it to some value, and then set it right back to the original value. To demonstrate I modified your fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/rd3ahxp8/5/) and introduced a time delay between the time you clear the values and the time you set them back. You can see, in this case, Vue has time to check to see that the values have changed and then they are changed back, you get your message. generateChart : function () { alert('generate') const saveType = this.formChart.type; this.formChart.type = ''; this.formChart.show = false; setTimeout(()=>{ this.formChart.type = saveType; this.formChart.show = true; }, 1000) } I think what should be triggering an update in your case is some change to dataChart. When that value changes, your Vue should re-render. You don't show, however, that it ever changes. Right now, if the data hasn't changed, and you don't want the user to see a different chart (because you're setting it back to the same value), why re-render at all? In order to get your chart to re-render when the chartData changes, you should watch the chartData property in your components. Here is a complete example of how I might do this. const ChartBase = { props: [\"chartData\"], methods:{ showChart(){ this.renderChart({ labels: this.chartData.labels, datasets: [ { label: 'Data One', backgroundColor: '#f87979', data: this.chartData.data } ] }, {responsive: true, maintainAspectRatio: false}) } }, mounted : function () { this.showChart() this.$watch(\"chartData.data\", this.showChart) }, } Vue.component('bar-chart', { extends: VueChartJs.Bar, mixins: [ChartBase] }); Vue.component('line-chart', { extends: VueChartJs.Line, mixins:[ChartBase] }); var Main = { data () { return { formChart : { type : 'line_chart', show : false, }, chartData:{ labels:['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'], data: [40, 39, 10, 40, 39, 80, 40] } }; }, methods : { generateChart : function () { const newChartData = [...this.chartData.data.reverse()] this.chartData.data = newChartData } }, } And here is a fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/rd3ahxp8/8/) showing the charts changing when the generate button is clicked.\n",

      "1 year later, Alan's answer helps me too, but my code failed when calling chart.destroy().

This is what happens: Vue first renders with 2 instances of chart-one, and the values [1, 2] When you click the button, Vue is asked to re-render with 1 chart-one [1] Vue updates the id variable on the first component to 2, and then sees it still has 1 unused component remaining, so it nukes it This can be solved in the following ways: Adding a key variable: If you add a key (https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#key) to the chart-one component, vue can actually do \"tracking\" of the instances: <chart-one :id=\"'chart-' + chart\" :key=\"chart\"></chart-one> Instead of doing the \"update values in the first component\" it now intelligently nukes and recreates dom nodes to match the values passed in.\n",

We are one hot encoding values in one Series (or a DataFrame column) and hence there is no need to use prefix. Pandas.get_dummies (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) on the other hand can one hot encode multiple columns. In which case, the prefix parameter works as an identifier of the original column. If you want to apply prefix to str.get_dummies, you can always use DataFrame.add_prefix (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.add_prefix.html) df['col'].str.get_dummies(sep=',').add_prefix('col_') Qn 2: If you have more than one column to begin with, how do you merge the dummies back into the original frame? You can use DataFrame.concat (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) to merge one hot encoded columns with the rest of the columns in dataframe. df = pd.DataFrame({'other':['x','y','x','x','q'],'col':['a','a,b,c','a,b,d','d','c,d']}) df = pd.concat([df, df['col'].str.get_dummies(sep=',')], axis = 1).drop('col', 1) other a b c d 0 x 1 0 0 0 1 y 1 1 1 0 2 x 1 1 0 1 3 x 0 0 0 1 4 q 0 0 1 1\n",

      "Why isn't my jQuery Ajax request functioning as expected?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post (https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post) jQuery.post( url [, data ] [, success ] [, dataType ] ) success Type: Function( PlainObject data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR ) A callback function that is executed if the request succeeds. Required if dataType is provided, but can be null in that case. If you read further The success callback function is passed the returned data Which probably means what you should be doing is var json = response; This of course assuming your request actually did receive the JSON\n",
      "\n",
      "The type of data being requested or rather say that the type of data endpoint provides i.e. JSON was not mentioned in the call. So changing the post call to $.post('/api/callfor/data', {}, function (resp) { var html = (resp.success) ? 'Your data is ' + resp.data : 'No data received'; }, 'json'); This returns the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like you have JSON in response but your dataType is set to script. As said in the docs (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/): \"script\": Evaluates the response as JavaScript and returns it as plain text. Disables caching by appending a query string parameter, \"_=[TIMESTAMP]\", to the URL unless the cache option is set to true. Note: This will turn POSTs into GETs for remote-domain requests. You should change dataType to json: \"json\": Evaluates the response as JSON and returns a JavaScript object. The JSON data is parsed in a strict manner; any malformed JSON is rejected and a parse error is thrown. As of jQuery 1.9, an empty response is also rejected; the server should return a response of null or {} instead. (See json.org for more information on proper JSON formatting.) and you'll get your response as object inside success. Also note that your service returns data with text/plain format. If you change it to application/json jQuery will \"guess\" dataType itself and you may omit it in $.ajax() call (I myself prefer to specify dataType).\n",
      "\n",
      "You're looking for responseText in the response, it won't be there. You'll find it instead on the jqXHR object itself (which is the third parameter passed to your done() function, and also returned by your whole $.ajax() call). And because you have dataType: \"json\" the response is already a JSON parsed object. Change this: .done( function(request){ alert(request.responseText); var data = JSON.parse(request.responseText); if(data.success){ //stuff here } }) To just this: .done( function(data){ if(data.success){ //stuff here } })\n",
      "\n",
      "The $.post method is shorthand for a call to $.ajax with certain parameters predefined. From the documentation on the ajax function from jQuery's website (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/), the complete callback is passed two parameters: jqXHR and textStatus, where jqXHR is the actual XMLHTTPRequest object. So it's the second parameter you want to pass to your handler: .complete(function(jqXHR, responseText) { actionFunction(responseText); }); Note that, as Dave Ward says in his answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6686062/how-to-acces-the-responsetext-in-the-jqxhr-complete-function/6686154#6686154), responseText in this case is really just a status indicator, like \"success\" or \"error\" (hence jQuery's name for it, \"textStatus\"). Given you have the word \"response\" in your variable name, I'm guessing (like he is) that you probably want the success callback instead of complete: .success(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { actionFunction(renderDataToString(data)); });\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this will fix: $.ajax({ url: _url, type: 'GET', dataType: 'json', success: function(response) { alert(response); console.log(\"response: \" + response); } }); You have made a typo error between success and sucess\n",
      "\n",
      "With your code the way it is currently this will not work as the error message directly indicates: Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to read the 'responseText' property from 'XMLHttpRequest': The value is only accessible if the object's 'responseType' is '' or 'text' (was 'json'). As you can see with the following proof: var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); //xhr.responseType = \"json\"; xhr.open(\"POST\", \"/echo/json/\"); xhr.send(\"hello world\"); xhr.onload = function() { console.log(xhr.response); console.log(xhr.responseText); } When you set the responseType to JSON you will not get a responseText property on the object. You will want to NOT set the responseType and evaluate the response (parseJSON) as a text string. If you have an error message for the response then your eval will fail to parse the JSON properly. This is alot like what jQuery does under the hood, and on that topic... Why fight with the improbable task of working with the native XMLHttpRequest browser object. jQuery has spend years normalizing AJAX (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) across browsers and standardizing an API. That API has an 'always' call back that will fit your needs perfectly. TLDR use jQuery for this and save the headaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jquery is being intelligent (most likely) based on the return content type. So the response is already a javascript object and should work without JSON.parse(). See https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ (https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) and find \"dataType\". dataType (default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)) Type: String The type of data that you're expecting back from the server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response (an XML MIME type will yield XML, in 1.4 JSON will yield a JavaScript object, in 1.4 script will execute the script, and anything else will be returned as a string). The available types (and the result passed as the first argument to your success callback) are:\n",
      "\n",
      "The response variable is an object which contains a lot of information about the response. It is not the same as your response text. Your second mistake is that your AJAX call is asynchronous, so you cannot obtain your response immediately after AJAX call. You need to wait for the response. Instead of var response = $.ajax({ type: 'POST', data: data, url: serverurl, dataType: 'JSON' }); console.info(response); dataString = JSON.stringify(response); alert(dataString); if(dataString.indexOf('error') > 0) { alert('Invalid user credentials, please try again'); }; you should write var response = $.ajax({ type: 'POST', data: data, url: serverurl, dataType: 'JSON', success: function(response) { console.info(response); dataString = JSON.stringify(response); alert(dataString); if(dataString.indexOf('error') > 0) { alert('Invalid user credentials, please try again'); }; } });\n",

      "\n",
      "The issue lies in how you've set up your AJAX request. Here are a few points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **dataType**: Ensure that the dataType is set correctly. In your case, since you expect a JSON response, you should set `dataType: 'json'`. This tells jQuery to parse the response as JSON automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Success Callback**: The success callback function is where you handle the response. Make sure you're accessing the response data correctly. With `dataType: 'json'`, the response will be a JavaScript object, not a string. So, you don't need to manually parse it using `JSON.parse()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Asynchronous Nature**: AJAX calls are asynchronous, meaning they don't block the execution of subsequent code. Therefore, you need to handle the response within the success callback function. Trying to access the response immediately after the AJAX call will not work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how your AJAX call should look:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "$.ajax({\n",
      "  url: '/api/callfor/data',\n",
      "  type: 'POST',\n",
      "  data: {}, // or your data object\n",
      "  dataType: 'json', // Set this to 'json' to parse the response as JSON\n",
      "  success: function(response) {\n",
      "    // Access the response data directly\n",
      "    if (response.success) {\n",
      "      // Handle successful response\n",
      "    } else {\n",
      "      // Handle error response\n",
      "    }\n",
      "  },\n",
      "  error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {\n",
      "    // Handle errors\n",
      "    console.error('AJAX Error:', textStatus, errorThrown);\n",
      "  }\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still encounter issues, ensure that the server is returning the correct response format and that there are no CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues if you're making cross-domain requests.\n",

      "\n",
      "It seems like you're encountering issues with `webix.require` in version 3.1 due to changes in asynchronous loading behavior. Here's how you can address these issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Forcing Old Behavior**: If you want to revert to the old synchronous loading behavior, use the second argument as `true` when calling `webix.require()`. For example:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "   This was suggested by @kozhemak.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Using Mouse Events**: When working with mouse events like `on_click`, ensure you include `webix.MouseEvents` alongside `webix.ui.view` and `webix.EventSystem`. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   webix.protoUI({\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct Event Attribute Usage**: Ensure you're using the correct attribute for event handlers. In your case, you were using `onclick` instead of `click`. Also, remember to include parentheses after the function call:\n",
      "\n",

The idea is to write your method in a way that it recurses down until the array has only one dimension. Once you're at the single-dimension level, do the work; otherwise, call yourself recursively, and aggregate your findings from the prior levels if necessary. Here is a quick demo: import java.util.*; import java.lang.*; import java.lang.reflect.Array; class Main { public static int sumArray(Object array) { Class type = array.getClass(); if (!type.isArray()) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"array\"); } Class ct = type.getComponentType(); int res = 0; int len = Array.getLength(array); if (ct.isArray()) { for (int i = 0 ; i != len ; i++) { res += sumArray(Array.get(array, i)); } } else { for (int i = 0 ; i != len ; i++) { res += Array.getInt(array, i); } } return res; } public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception { int[] a = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}; int aa[][] = new int[][] {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; int aaa[][][] = new int[][][]{{{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}},{{7,8},{9,10},{11,12}}}; System.out.println(sumArray(a)); System.out.println(sumArray(aa)); System.out.println(sumArray(aaa)); } }\n",

Use this method like this: Integer[][][] array = {{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}}, {{9}, {10}}}; int sum = flatMapDynamicArray(array) .mapToInt(i -> (int) i) .sum(); The result in all cases will be 55 for the array you shared.\n",

      "    ```java\n",
      "   .toArray(int[][][]::new);\n",
      "    ```\n",

      "For instance, what does the \"200\" in the \"Cnt\" column exactly represent? The cnt column is the number of iterations - i.e. how many times a tests is repeated. You can control that value using the following annotations: For the actual measurements: @Measurement(iterations = 10, time = 50, timeUnit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS) For the warmup phase: @Warmup(iterations = 10, time = 1, timeUnit = TimeUnit.SECONDS) Here iterations is cnt; time is the required duration of one iteration, and timeUnit is the unit of measurement of the time value. The throughput units are in \"operations per second\" You can control the output in several ways. For instance you can change the unit of measurement for the time using @OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.XXXX), so you can get ops/us, ops/ms You can also change the mode: instead of measureing ops/time you can measure \"average time\", \"sample time\", etc. You can control this via the @BenchmarkMode({Mode.AverageTime}) annotation so what exactly does the \"operation\" represent, is that the execution of one call to the benchmark method So lets say one iteration is 1 second long and you get 1000 ops/sec. This means that the benchamrk method has been executed 1000 times. In other words one operation is one execution of the benchmark method, unless you have the @OperationsPerInvocation(XXX) annotation, which means tha teach invocation of the methods will count as XXX operations. The error is calculated across all iterations. One more tip: instead of hardcoding each possible size, you can do a parameterized benchmark: @Param({\"3\", \"12\", \"300\", \"3000\"}) private int length; Then you can use that param in your setup: @Setup(Level.Iteration) public void setUp(){ populateList(length) }\n",

      "Enum advantages from this question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4822877/why-doesnt-android-use-more-enums): They are much more type-safe than integers, strings, or sets of boolean flags. They lead to more readable code. It's more difficult to set an enum to an invalid value than an int or string. They make it easy to discover the allowed values for a variable or parameter. Everything I've read indicates that they perform just as well as integers in C# and most JVMs. I would add: Enums can have member and instance variables, whereas an int can't. Like most abstractions, they are generally unequivocally advantageous once their performance catches up (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5143256/why-was-avoid-enums-where-you-only-need-ints-removed-from-androids-performance). Especially in your application code (as opposed to framework code) I would choose enums over other methods that simulate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference is that the constants are preferred on Android as they consume less memory. Enums often require more than twice as much memory as static constants. You should strictly avoid using enums on Android. See https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/memory.html (https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/memory.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "They do it mainly for performance, as others have said. The main performance impact is the amount of memory they use. I feel this is the best resource on the matter (from the horses mouth) https://youtu.be/Hzs6OBcvNQE (https://youtu.be/Hzs6OBcvNQE) I know a video is unusual here on SO but it is the most to the point resource on the matter. A side point: Though Enums are not performance optimised, most apps done in Android Studio should be fine if they use Progaurd to convert all enums at compile time to static final ints. I do this as I find Enums a little more expressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enums in Java are not just a placeholder for integers, or just some constants (such as some languages). Enums are classes with fixed number of objects, so it is a good practice to give your enums more brain, and always forget about lots of if/else or *switch/case*es.\n",
      "\n",
      "Readability: Enums Convention: Enums Efficiency: You shouldn't care until you know you have a problem. It is very unlikely that you will ever encounter a performance problem due to the use of Enums.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you're taking the usage of enums way to far and then come to a conclusion that they are not useful. Enums are simply telling you that there's a limited and predefined number of options to choose from. Nothing more than that. For example, when you see a parameter that is an enum (let's say State) and it has 3 values (Pending, InProgress, Closed), you know that a state of some object can have one of those and only one of those values. Enums provide an easy way of validating that a proper value is used as you cannot easily select a value that is not proper when coding. They are also a way of documenting as you can easily see what options are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "One benefit of using enums is that it's strongly typed. Consider two sets of constants, both of which have integer representations. If you just use fields as you've proposed, there's nothing to stop you from passing the wrong kind of value into methods etc. If you use enums, you can't - the two sets of constants are entirely distinct, even though they share the common aspect of \"values with underlying integer representations\". Of course, enums provide additional benefits in allowing you to include behaviour for the values, but that's not always necessary - and even when it's not, that doesn't mean that enums aren't useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible answer is that enums were introduced in Java 1.5. While this seems like ancient history, some libraries still use string constants or numeric constants for compatibility reasons. Another possible answer is that those are not really semantically enum elements, but constants used by an external interface and are only ever accessed via their string value. In such cases, using enums and calling name() each time would be redundant. Other than that, you should never use enums over string constants in such cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, you should avoid using enums in Android environment. Prefer to use @IntDef (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/annotation/IntDef.html), @StringDef (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/annotation/StringDef.html). The main reasoning behind this is the waste of resources. Enums take much more memory. As Colt McAnlis shows in this perfmatters episode (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzs6OBcvNQE) enums take 13x more space on rather trivial example. Secondly, what you want to achieve may be done via Intents or Bundles, passing a boolean value from one component to another.\n",

      "\n",
      "Using enums in Android development is generally discouraged due to their higher memory consumption compared to primitive types like integers or strings. However, this does not mean they should be completely avoided. Instead, consider the following guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use enums for small, finite sets**: If you have a small, fixed set of values that represent distinct concepts, using an enum might be appropriate. This improves code readability and maintainability, as the intent behind each value is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid large enums**: Be cautious with enums containing many elements, especially if memory efficiency is critical. Large enums can significantly increase your app's memory footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use annotations**: When you need to restrict a variable or method parameter to a specific set of values, prefer using `@IntDef` or `@StringDef` annotations provided by the Android Support Library. These annotations offer similar benefits to enums without the increased memory overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider alternative approaches**: For larger sets of values or when inter-component communication is required, consider using Intent extras or Bundle parameters instead of enums. These alternatives can help minimize memory usage while maintaining code clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while enums can improve code readability and maintainability, their higher memory consumption makes them less suitable for Android development. Use them judiciously, focusing on small, finite sets of values, and explore alternative approaches when dealing with larger value sets or inter-component communication requirements.\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use matplotlib.pyplot.Normalize (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.Normalize.html) so the data is normalized to the [0-1] interval when fed to the plot function. Here is an example of what it would look like, using the normalized ranges a = [4,3,2,5,6,20,1,34] # An example colormap colormap = plt.cm.cool # Normalize using the min and max values in a normalize = plt.Normalize(vmin=min(a), vmax=max(a)) # scatter plot with the parameters defined above plt.scatter(range(len(a)), y=a, c=a, cmap=colormap, marker='o') (https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lq9F8.png) Note that you will have to use a as the c argument in matplotlib.pyplot.scatter (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html), which as mentioned in the docs accepts: Color, sequence, or sequence of color, optional So this way you will be using the array a to select values from the colormap which will in turn be normalized by the ,ax and min values in a.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.random.rand(100) y = np.random.rand(100) t = np.arange(100) plt.scatter(x, y, c=t) plt.show() Here you are setting the color based on the index, t, which is just an array of [1, 2, ..., 100]. Perhaps an easier-to-understand example is the slightly simpler import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.arange(100) y = x t = x plt.scatter(x, y, c=t) plt.show() Note that the array you pass as c doesn't need to have any particular order or type, i.e. it doesn't need to be sorted or integers as in these examples. The plotting routine will scale the colormap such that the minimum/maximum values in c correspond to the bottom/top of the colormap. Colormaps You can change the colormap by adding import matplotlib.cm as cm plt.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap=cm.cmap_name) Importing matplotlib.cm is optional as you can call colormaps as cmap=\"cmap_name\" just as well. There is a reference page (http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html) of colormaps showing what each looks like. Also know that you can reverse a colormap by simply calling it as cmap_name_r. So either plt.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap=cm.cmap_name_r) # or plt.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap=\"cmap_name_r\") will work. Examples are \"jet_r\" or cm.plasma_r. Here's an example with the new 1.5 colormap viridis: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.arange(100) y = x t = x fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2) ax1.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap='viridis') ax2.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap='viridis_r') plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIjeW.png) Colorbars You can add a colorbar by using plt.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap='viridis') plt.colorbar() plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzkp5.png) Note that if you are using figures and subplots explicitly (e.g. fig, ax = plt.subplots() or ax = fig.add_subplot(111)), adding a colorbar can be a bit more involved. Good examples can be found here for a single subplot colorbar (http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/examples/pylab_examples/colorbar_tick_labelling_demo.html) and here for 2 subplots 1 colorbar (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13784887/1634191).\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a look at the docs for matplotlib.pyplot.scatter (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) which describes a parameter c, which can be A sequence of color specifications of length n. Here is an example, which creates 100 random x and y data points. If y value is over 5, the point will be blue, else red as specified in c list. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import random x = list(range(100)) y = [random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(len(x))] c = [\"b\" if y > 5 else \"r\" for y in y] plt.scatter(x, y, c=c) plt.show() The output will look like this: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/gNPfh.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't mind using built-in colormaps, you can find guidance here (https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html). To use it, your c should be your 500 possible values which determines corresponding color. Use cmap to specify which colormap you want to use. You can also draw a colorbar to give an idea about the colormap. A simple complete example: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.arange(500) y = x.copy() np.random.shuffle(x) plt.scatter(x, y, c=y, cmap='summer') plt.colorbar() plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/uABq8.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what matplotlib.pyplot.scatter (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) is for. If no colormap is specified, scatter will use whatever the default colormap is set to. To specify which colormap scatter should use, use the cmap kwarg (e.g. cmap=\"jet\"). As a quick example: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.colors as mcolors import numpy as np # Generate data... t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 20) x = np.sin(t) y = np.cos(t) plt.scatter(t, x, c=y, ec='k') plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/C5UlZ.png) One may specify a custom color map and norm cmap, norm = mcolors.from_levels_and_colors([0, 2, 5, 6], ['red', 'green', 'blue']) plt.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap=cmap, norm=norm) (https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3fjs.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea to use a colormap to colorize the points of a scatter is of course justified. If you're using the plt.scatter plot, you can supply the values according to which the colormap chooses the color in the c argument. Here you only want two values, so c= np.sign(df.y) would be an appropriate choice. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame({'x': np.arange(25), 'y': np.random.normal(0,2500,25)}) fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.scatter(df.x, df.y, c=np.sign(df.y), cmap=\"bwr\") plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/akoQF.png)\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Using a colormap:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - First, import the necessary libraries:\n",
      "\n",
      "     ```python\n",

      "     plt.scatter(x, y, c=t, cmap='viridis')\n",
      "     plt.show()\n",

      "2. **Using a sequence of colors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - You can also directly use a sequence of colors:\n",
      "\n",
      "     ```python\n",

      "     plt.show()\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using a normalization object:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - For more fine-grained control, you can use `matplotlib.colors.Normalize` to normalize your data before applying the colormap:\n",
      "\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     from matplotlib.colors import Normalize\n",
      "\n",
      "     # Normalize the data\n",
      "     normalize = Normalize(vmin=min(t), vmax=max(t))\n",
      "     c = normalize(t)\n",

      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason your first snippet generates alert on the first click on button is event propagation, specifically event bubbling (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4616694/what-is-event-bubbling-and-capturing#4616720). When you click the button, after the event handler has executed, the same event propagates up the DOM tree; eventually it reaches the document element, and triggers the new event handler that you subscribe to. One of the approaches to ensure that the event doesn't immediately trigger at document would be to prevent the propagation of the event by calling event.stopPropagation() (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation). You can see that in action in the snippet below: $(document).ready(function() { $(\"#Btn\").click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); $(document).click(function() { alert(\"Clicked!\"); $(document).unbind('click'); }); }); }); <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <div id=\"container\"> <button id=\"Btn\">Click</button> </div>\n",

      "You are attaching an event handler for first time. After the second time it will work and will again attach an event handler. You don't need to use inline event handler, avoid this type of event handler attachement. You can just remove the hide function part serving the content. When your code runs, it will attach the event handler const z = document.getElementById('button'); const y = document.getElementById('block'); z.onclick = () => { y.style.display = 'none'; }; <div id=\"block\"> <button id=\"button\">my button</button> </div>\n",

You then bind an event handler for that same event type somewhere higher up the DOM tree. The event then continues bubbling up the tree and reaches the document, where it triggers the new event handler. Here's a working example (http://jsfiddle.net/bNaFV/5/). Update (see comments) As noted by @zerkms in the comments, I think you probably only want to bind the event handler to document once. You could use the one (http://api.jquery.com/one/) method to do so, which unbinds the event handler after it's been executed once: $(document).one('click', 'html', function(){ $('#show_me').hide(); });\n",

      "The reason that the onclick event is showing twice, is because there is something called event bubbling in JavaScript. Take a look at the following: This image shows that, if the <img> was clicked, the event would \"bubble\" up to the <p> tag, then to the <div>, then to the rest of the document. If there was an onclick event on the <p> tag, and even if the <p> tag was not clicked (but the <img> was), the event would necessarily \"bubble\" all the way up the DOM, and would still continue when an event was fired on the <p> tag (in other words, if you also had an onclick event on the <div>, then that would fire as well. So what you should do is this: <div id=\"sparentId\" onclick=\"javascript:somemethod()\" > <button id=\"childId\"></button> </div> In other words, as I explained above, you wouldn't need the extra onclick event handler in your button anymore, because when your button is clicked, the event bubbles up to the parent div, which would fire that event. If you want to use your original HTML code, that's fine as well - just add this: function somemethod(evt) { // the method you run // some code evt.stopPropagation(); // stops bubbling } This effectively stops the event from bubbling up your DOM tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediate reasons I can see are: you are attaching an event before the DOM is even loaded or before the element is available in the DOM (if you're loading JS in the head instead of bottom of body for example) multiple element's with the same ID you have a stopPropagation on button elements (or this particular identifier) which is blocking the callback Other than the above, it's hard to determine what is going on without more code/information. If its a matter of when you are attaching the listener, try adding $(document).ready() around your event listener.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is due to the fact that your element is dynamically created, so it is attached to the DOM later, but your addEventListener call already occurred in the past.

This is useful if, for example, instead of your <input id=\"btnPrepend\"/> you had a <button id=\"btnPrepend\"><i class=\"icon\">+</i> prepend</button> and you clicked the <i class=\"icon\">+</i>. jQuery makes it easier: $(document).on(\"click\", \"#btnPrepend\", function(){ // Do something with `$(this)`. }); Here is an article about event delegation (https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate).\n",

      "ANSWER: \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue here seems to be related to event propagation and bubbling in JavaScript. When you click on an element, the click event not only triggers the event handler attached directly to that element but also propagates upwards through the DOM, potentially triggering handlers attached to ancestors of that element.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your case, you're likely attaching a click event handler to an element, and when you click on that element, the event is propagating upwards to the document level where another handler might be attached. To prevent this behavior, you can use `event.stopPropagation()`. This prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can modify your code to include `event.stopPropagation()`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "const z = document.getElementById('button');\n",
      "z.onclick = function(e) {\n",
      "  e.stopPropagation();\n",
      "  const y = document.getElementById('block');\n",
      "  y.style.display = 'none';\n",
      "};\n",
      "\n",
      "<div id=\"block\">\n",
      "  <button id=\"button\">my button</button>\n",
      "</div>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if you're using jQuery, you can use `.one()` to ensure that the event handler is only bound once:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "$(document).one('click', '#Btn', function(e) {\n",
      "  e.stopPropagation();\n",
      "  $(document).unbind('click');\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, `#Btn` is the ID of the button element, and `$(document).unbind('click')` removes any previously attached click handlers to the document, ensuring that only one handler remains active.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're dynamically creating buttons and adding them to the DOM, consider using event delegation, which allows you to attach a single event handler to a parent element that will handle events for child elements that match a specific selector:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "$(document).on('click', '.my-button-class', function() {\n",
      "  // Your event handling logic here\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, regardless of how many buttons are added to the DOM, they will all share the same event handler, and you won't encounter issues with multiple event bindings.\n",

The Arrays#asList() (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#asList%28T...%29) takes arguments as varargs (http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/varargs.html) and returns a List (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html) (which is a Collection (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html)). So, you could do it as follows: validStates = new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList(\"AL\", \"AK\", \"..\")); It makes however more sense to have them in some properties file or in a DB which you load by one or two lines of code so that you don't need to hardcode them all in Java. If you were on Java 8+, you could just use Stream#of() (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#of-T...-). validStates = Stream.of(\"AK\", \"AL\", \"..\").collect(Collectors.toSet());\n",

      "\n",
      "You need lastIndexOf and substr... var t = \"\\\\some\\\\route\\\\here\"; t = t.substr(0, t.lastIndexOf(\"\\\\\")); alert(t); Also, you need to double up \\ chars in strings as they are used for escaping special characters. Update Since this is regularly proving useful for others, here's a snippet example... // the original string var t = \"\\\\some\\\\route\\\\here\"; // remove everything after the last backslash var afterWith = t.substr(0, t.lastIndexOf(\"\\\\\") + 1); // remove everything after & including the last backslash var afterWithout = t.substr(0, t.lastIndexOf(\"\\\\\")); // show the results console.log(\"before : \" + t); console.log(\"after (with \\\\) : \" + afterWith); console.log(\"after (without \\\\) : \" + afterWithout);\n",
      "\n",
      "In JavaScript string a single backslash is represented using \"\\\\\". That's because \\\" represents a single \" character and doesn't terminate the string. The regex you wrote actually has no effect because the string doesn't contain two backslashes next to one another. You can (and should) use \\\\ in any place/function that expects a backslash. alert(\"Backslash: \\\\\"); // alert(\"Backslash: \\\"); // SyntaxError However, the JavaScript console sometimes likes to display the sting in JavaScript notation, so it replaces \\ with \\\\ in order to print valid code. This also sometimes happens when typing just a string in the console REPL. console.log(\"%o\", \"\\\\\"); console.log({ backslash: \"\\\\\"}); Notice the \"sometimes\". Per spec (https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#printer), the JavaScript console printer is implementation-defined. Although most consoles, including Node.js's, in these circumstances display \"\\\\\" (a valid JavaScript string), Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers display \"\\\" (the actual string value, wrapped in \"). P.S.: There's also a way to make the parser parse a single backslash as a single backslash, using String.raw(), however, it has some limitations: alert(String.raw `C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe`); // alert(String.raw `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`); // SyntaxError because string ends with \\\n",

      "The backslash (\\) is an escape character (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) in Javascript (along with a lot of other C-like languages). This means that when Javascript encounters a backslash, it tries to escape the following character. For instance, \\n is a newline character (rather than a backslash followed by the letter n). In order to output a literal backslash, you need to escape it. That means \\\\ will output a single backslash (and \\\\\\\\ will output two, and so on). The reason \"aa ///\\\" doesn't work is because the backslash escapes the \" (which will print a literal quote), and thus your string is not properly terminated. Similarly, \"aa ///\\\\\\\" won't work, because the last backslash again escapes the quote. Just remember, for each backslash you want to output, you need to give Javascript two.\n",

You can still be thrown off by a delimiter occurring in a comment or RegExp literal, fx var m = /\"/g.exec(\"a string\"); // Matches a '\"' char // ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not strings! so it's not perfect for finding all strings in a JavaScript source.

      "Inconsistencies observed while utilizing array.reduce in JavaScript\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because, reduce method does not mutate the array. reduce returning new value which you are not using to console.log function sumArray(array) { array.sort(function(a,b){return a-b}) console.log(array) //log1 array.splice(0, 1) array.splice(-1, 1) const sum = array.reduce(function(a,b){return a+b}, 0); console.log(sum) //log2 return sum; } console.log('Sum: ', sumArray([2, 5, 6])); Also, for use case of calculating sum, you dont need to pass 0 for init value. reduce consider the first value as init value and continue from 2nd item from array. MDN reduce (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) const sum = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b);\n",
      "\n",
      "The function passed to reduce (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) should always return something, specifically a value that can be used in the reduction calculation. Currently yours doesn't if index === 0. The default return value is undefined, and once you perform math on undefined you get NaN. Return a value. For example, if you want to return 0: const numberArray = [2, 23, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; const added = numberArray.reduce((sum, indexValue, index, numberArray) => { if(index === 0) { console.log(`${index} : ${indexValue}`); return 0; // <--- here }else{ return sum += indexValue; } }, 0); console.log(added);\n",
      "\n",
      "No, reduce (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) doesn't default the accumulator. When you call reduce with just one argument (the callback), the first call it makes to the callback uses the first entry as the accumulator and the second entry as the value to \"add\" to it. Of course, it can only do that when the array has at least two entries. When there's only one entry in the array and you don't provide an accumulator default, the entry's value is the result of reduce (and your callback isn't called at all). That's why console.log([0].reduce(r)); gives you 0. Finally, if you call reduce on an empty array and don't provide a default, it's an error. (Which is why a.reduce((a, b) => a + b) and a.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) are not the same thing.) Examples: // Outputs 1 without calling the callback console.log([1].reduce((acc, value) => { console.log(`acc = ${acc}, value = ${value}`); return acc + value; })); // Outputs 3 after calling the callback with acc = 1 and value = 2 console.log([1, 2].reduce((acc, value) => { console.log(`acc = ${acc}, value = ${value}`); return acc + value; })); let a = []; // Throws an error try { console.log(a.reduce((a, b) => a + b)); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } // Works try { console.log(a.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } .as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for that is that the callback for the .reduce() (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method you use takes up to 4 arguments, and the first one is an accumulator. It means that it holds the accumulated value of all of the previous results returned by the callback. In this case, it's a number, not an object. So in each iteration, you have the current sum under p argument, not an object. From the docs: accumulator The accumulator accumulates callback's return values. It is the accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback—or initialValue, if it was supplied (see below).\n",

      "You're approaching reduce incorrectly. You're almost using it like Array#forEach. Remember that callbacks are functions. They expect to return an actual value. When you read the docs, you'll see that reduce also needs an accumulator, that is an argument after the callback. const sum = obj[key].reduce(function(a,b){ return a + b }, 0) Or if you want the newer and prettier version: const sum = obj[key].reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0) When you have a one liner, return is implicit, which means it's implied, as opposed to explicit. The accumulator is what your value starts at while it totals up the values. Array.reduce(callback, accumulator)\n",

      "You did not pass an initial value to .reduce (which should be the second argument passed), so the initial value is the first item in the array - the {key: \"a\", value: 1}.

The { price, quantity } is object destructering (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring) of the current value. const sumTotal = arr => arr.reduce((sum, { price, quantity }) => sum + price * quantity, 0) const data = [ { id: 1, price: 30, quantity: 2 }, { id: 2, price: 20, quantity: 4 }, { id: 3, price: 10, quantity: 2 }, ] const total = sumTotal(data) console.log(total) // 160 Here is a similar example (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce#Sum_of_values_in_an_object_array).\n",

      "The value that the reduce callback returns will be the accumulator in the next iteration. So, in your code, obj only refers to the object in the first iteration - on the next iteration, it refers to what obj[key] = '' resolves to, which is the empty string. Return the object instead: const f = ['a', 'b', 'c'].reduce((obj, key) => { obj[key] = ''; return obj; }, {}); console.log(f); You could use Object.fromEntries instead, if you wanted (though, it's very new, so for good cross-browser support, include a polyfill): const f = Object.fromEntries( ['a', 'b', 'c'].map(key => [key, '']) ); console.log(f);\n",

      "When you use reduce() you need to return the accumulator acc from the callback Second thing you need to understand is implicit return.

I mentioned above when you use reduce() you need to return acc from ur function.

      "To select a random element from a list, tuple, or string, you can use the `random.choice()` function from Python's built-in `random` module. Here's how you can do it for each data type:\n",

      "1. **List**: The most straightforward way is to call `random.choice()` directly on the list.\n",

      "   foo = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n",

      "   ```python\n",
      "   import random\n",
      "   monsters = (\"trolls\", \"ogres\", \"werewolves\", \"dragons\")\n",
      "   print(random.choice(monsters))\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **String**: Strings are sequences of characters, so you can also use `random.choice()` with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import random\n",
      "   s = \"Hello\"\n",
      "   print(random.choice(s))\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to select multiple random elements without repetition, you can use a combination of `random.sample()`. For example, to choose two random elements from a list:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",

      "foo = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n",
      "print(random.sample(foo, 2))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This will return a new list containing two unique random elements from the original list. If the list has fewer than two elements, it will raise a `ValueError`.\n",

      "I would say that both approaches show bad OOP design and I believe should be avoided unless your whole ExampleClass API (including constructor) is already exposed to customers and should be preserved as is for backward compatibility. If this is not the case, I think some variation of Factory pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) should be used, probably something like \"static factory methods\" as described at http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/creating-and-destroying-java-objects-par/208403883 (http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/creating-and-destroying-java-objects-par/208403883). With such approach you can easily create objects of different sub-types depending on parameters. Moreover you can provide different factory methods with different names that better reflect meaning of created objects instead of just analyzing parameteres. If your API should be preserved and performance is not critically important (and given you use Python, I take it for granted), I'd vote for making ExampleClass a wrapper that just delegates all the real work to inner delegate that is created via factory. Something like this: class ExampleClass(object): def __init__(self, a=None, b=None): if a is not None: self._delegate = ExampleAImpl(a) else: self._delegate = ExampleBImpl(b) def method(self): return self._delegate.methodImpl() class ExampleAImpl(object): def __init__(self, a): self.a = a def methodImpl(self): return \"I am a method that relies on input: \" + self.a class ExampleBImpl(object): def __init__(self, b): self.b = b def methodImpl(self): return \"I am a method that relies on input: \" + self.b Note: This approaches doesn't work well with inheritance from ExampleClass. Also if you need your a and b to still be public properties, it can be done but makes code much more convoluted.\n",

      "Your taste may vary, but the Pythonic(tm) style is to just go ahead and use objects as you need to. If they don't support the operations you're attempting, an exception will be raised. This is known as duck typing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). There are a few reasons for favoring this style: first, it enables polymorphism by allowing you to use new kinds of objects with existing code so long as the new objects support the right operations. Second, it streamlines the successful path by avoiding numerous checks. Of course, the error message you get when using wrong arguments will be clearer with type checking than with duck typing, but as I say, your taste may vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second way ObjectClassB is better because it respects object encapsulation. In order to decrease the number of arguments, you can use dictionaries (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries), like this example. def do_something_else(self): args = {'a':self.variable_a, 'b':self.variable_b, 'c':self.variable_c} self.object_b = ObjectClassB(args) class ObjectClassB: def __init__(self, mydict): self.variable_a = mydict['a'] self.variable_b = mydict['b'] self.variable_c = mydict['c']\n",

      "\n",
      "The simple answer is No, use Polymorphism, Exceptions etc. In the case of constructor arguments being of the wrong type, an exception will be thrown when executing code that depend s on the parameter being of a particular type. If it is a weird, domain specific thing, raise your own Exception. Surround blocks of code which are likely to fail with try-except and handle errors. So it is better to use Exception handling. (Same goes for function arguments) In properties, the same argument applies. If you are validating the value received, use an assertion to check its range etc. If the value is of the wrong type, it will fail anyway. Then, handle AssertionError. In Python, you treat programmers as intelligent beings!! Just document your code well (make things obvious), raise Exceptions where appropriate, write polymorphic code etc. Leave the Exception handling(where it is appropriate only)/errors in construction to the client code. Warning Leaving Exception handling to clients doesn't mean that you should chuck a lot of garbage errors at the unwitting user. If at all possible, handle exceptions that might occur due to bad construction or any other reason in your code itself. Your code should be robust. Where it is impossible for you to handle the error, politely inform the user/client code programmer! Note In general, bad arguments to a constructor isn't something I worry about too much.\n",

      "In Python 2, there's 2 types of classes (https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ref/node33.html). To use the new-style, you have to inherit explicitly from object. If not, the old-style implementation is used. In Python 3, all classes extend object implicitly, whether you say so yourself or not. You probably will want to use the new-style class anyway but if you code is supposed to work with both python 2 and 3 you'll have to explicitly inherit from object: class Foo(object): pass To jump on the other answer, yes the Zen of Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python) state that Explicit is better than implicit. I think this mean we should avoid possible confusion in code like we should in language in general, remember code is communication. If you only work with python 3, and your code/project explicitly state that, there is no possible confusion, all class without explicit inheritance automatically inherit from object. If for some obscure reason the base class change in the future (let's imagine from object to Object), the same code will work. And the Zen of Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python) also says that Simple is better than complex. (of course complex is quite an overstatement in this example but still...) So again if you code only support python3, you should use the simplest form: class Foo: pass The form with just () is quite useless since it doesn't give any valuable information.\n",

      "If your question is about the purpose of typing.Generic (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic) I would suggest you read through PEP 484 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0484). It has a section dedicated to user defined generic classes (https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#user-defined-generic-types) with some examples specifically for this, but the entire document is worthwhile reading IMHO. If you are unsure about the entire concept of generic types, the Wikipedia articles on parametric polymorphism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) and generic programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) might even be worth skimming. In very simple terms, you can use the Generic base class to define your own classes in a generic way, i.e. parameterized with regards to one or more type arguments. These type parameters are constructed via typing.TypeVar (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar). It is worth noting that in most cases these things are only relevant for the purposes of type safety, which is not really enforced by Python itself. Instead, static type checkers (most IDEs have them built-in) deal with those things. As to your example, it is entirely possible to define your class in a generic way and thus improve your own coding experience because you'll likely get useful auto-suggestions and warnings by your IDE. This only really becomes useful, if you use the type variables somewhere else throughout your class. Example: from typing import Generic, TypeVar class Base: pass ModelType = TypeVar(\"ModelType\", bound=Base) class CRUDBase(Generic[ModelType]): def __init__(self, model: type[ModelType]): self.model = model def get_model_instance(self) -> ModelType: return self.model() class Sub(Base): def foo(self) -> None: print(\"hi mom\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": crud_a = CRUDBase(Sub) crud_b = CRUDBase(Base) a = crud_a.get_model_instance() b = crud_b.get_model_instance() a.foo() b.foo() # error A good type checker like mypy will know, that a is of the Sub type and thus has the foo method, whereas b is of the Base type and therefore does not. And it will know so just from the way we annotated CRUDBase. PyCharm for example struggles with this (don't know why). Fortunately, we can help it out with explicit type annotations because we defined CRUDBase as a generic type: ... crud_a: CRUDBase[Sub] = CRUDBase(Sub) crud_b: CRUDBase[Base] = CRUDBase(Base) a = crud_a.get_model_instance() b = crud_b.get_model_instance() a.foo() b.foo() # PyCharm marks `foo` and complains Notice that so far there is nothing particularly \"abstract\" about our CRUDBase. It is fully self-contained and functioning like this (albeit not very useful yet). If you want a class to be an abstract base and not be directly instantiated, the abc (https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) module provides you with the tools you need. You can define an abstract base class and abstract methods (https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod) on it that all subclasses must implement. But I think it is clear now that this is a different concept. The idea is that an abstract class is not intended to be instantiated, only its subclasses are. I hope this helps point you in a few useful directions.\n",

      "You can indicate that a variable is a reference to a type with the annotation Type[BaseX] (see Python docs on Type (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Type)). A variable annotated with Type[T] holds any type that is a subtype of T. For your specific use case of \"constructing an object of the specified type, which is a subtype of BaseX\", you can use more accurate annotations with the help of TypeVar (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar). For example: T = TypeVar('T', bound=BaseX) def construct(cls: Type[T], *args, **kwargs) -> T: return cls(*args, **kwargs) Here: TypeVar('T', bound=BaseX) defines a \"type variable\" that can be substituted with any type \"bounded\" by BaseX, i.e., is a subtype of BaseX. The construct function takes an argument cls with annotation Type[T], indicating it's a reference to a subtype of BaseX. The return type annotation is T, indicating the returned value is an instance of the subtype of BaseX. All occurrences of a type variable within a function or class are bound to the same type. In this case, the type of the returned value is the type passed as argument.\n",

      "The decision to include a method or constructor parameter for an object that can be derived from an alternative parameter depends on various factors, including maintainability, flexibility, and the specific requirements of your project. Here are some considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Maintainability**: If the class hierarchy is complex and subject to frequent changes, having multiple constructors or methods can make maintenance difficult. It may introduce conditional logic that is hard to follow and debug. In such cases, using a single constructor or method with additional parameters or a factory pattern can simplify the codebase.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Flexibility**: If the class needs to support a wide range of instantiations, providing multiple constructors or methods can offer greater flexibility. For example, if certain subclasses require specific initialization parameters, separate constructors can ensure proper instantiation. However, this can lead to code duplication and increased complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Performance**: In general, the overhead of method calls and parameter passing is minimal and unlikely to significantly impact performance. Therefore, the choice should primarily focus on clarity and maintainability rather than performance concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pythonic Approach**: Python encourages duck typing and composition over inheritance. If the alternatives can fulfill the required interface, using duck typing can simplify the code and promote better separation of concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Polymorphism**: Using polymorphism and abstraction allows for cleaner, more extensible code. By defining common interfaces and using factories or dependency injection, you can decouple classes and enable easier testing and maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Type Safety**: If type safety is a concern, especially in larger projects, using type hints and generics (as demonstrated with `TypeVar`) can enhance code reliability and catch potential issues early through static analysis tools like mypy.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Backward Compatibility**: If the API is already exposed and needs to remain compatible, adding new constructors or methods can break existing implementations. In such cases, a factory pattern or a wrapper class can provide a backward-compatible solution while allowing for future enhancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while both approaches have their merits, the decision should prioritize maintainability and flexibility. If the class hierarchy is complex or the requirements are diverse, a factory pattern or a wrapper class can provide a clean and maintainable solution. For simpler cases, duck typing and composition can suffice, offering a more Pythonic approach that aligns with the language's philosophy of simplicity and readability. Always consider the specific context\n",

      "JProfiler is a tool for profiling applications running on the Java virtual machine. Even though Android uses the Java language, it runs on a different virtual machine, so you can't use any of the Java profilers such as JProfiler or YourKit to profile the applications. Instead, you need to use the Google-provided tools such as DDMS.\n",

      "\n",
      "Possibilities The Profiler settings are excluding your classes. Change the excludes in the Profiler settings. Your application was idle while the profiler was running. Attach the profiler then cause the program to execute the code you want to profile. You might be profiling the wrong JVM. RMI makes it pretty easy to call into another JVM. Maybe you need to be profiling the other side of that RMI connection. There is a \"Settings\" checkbox on the Profiler tab. If you check the Settings box another panel will show up that lets you configure what classes the profiler collects data about. Here is a screenshot.\n",

      "That is because of problem about memory chunk(See below reference for details). If the program has new version, use newer but sometimes programs dont have new version and you have to use it essentially. If any program(not just JProfiler) gives that problem, do below steps: Search for .vmoptions under the program folder. Open it with text editor. Decrease -Xmx size(try decreasing order, for ex: 512m,256m,128m,64m) until finding right size. For each size try to start the program.

      "If you are using Java from Sun and you use at least Java 6 update 10 (i.e. the newest), then try running jvisualvm from the JDK on the same machine as your program is running, and attach to it and enable profiling. This is most likely the simplest way to get started.\n",

      "This happens if the maximum size limit for the method bytecode would be exceeded by adding the instrumentation. See Maximum size of a method in java? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6570343/maximum-size-of-a-method-in-java) Adding a filter for the class reduces this problem. In more recent versions of JProfiler you can also add the method to the list of ignored methods then it will not be instrumented at all. And, as the message says, this is not a problem when you use sampling instead of instrumentation.\n",

Get async-profiler from https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/releases (https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/releases), and set the path to libasyncProfiler.so in LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable or in -Djava.library.path JVM option.

      "Manually adding a VM parameter to a run configuration in eclipse is not recommended for profiling with JProfiler. For more on the eclipse IDE integration, see this screen cast (http://blog.ej-technologies.com/2009/06/jprofilers-ide-integrations.html) and this help page (http://resources.ej-technologies.com/jprofiler/help/doc/ide/eclipse.html). You can then profile JBoss with an eclipse run configuration without adding any VM parameters. There are other ways to profile without manually adding any VM parameters: The easiest way to get started is to use the \"Quick attach\" feature in JProfiler. With \"Session->Quick Attach\" you get a list of running JVMs that you can profile without having to add any JVM parameters. If you miss source code navigation to eclipse in the above step, the same action is available in eclipse if the JProfiler plugin is installed. For standalone configuration, use the integration wizard by invoking \"Session->Integration Wizards->New Server Integration\" from JProfiler's main menu. The integration wizard will modify the start script, so that you don't have to add any VM parameters. For the error message that you got, I suspect that C:\\Users\\user\\.jprofiler6\\config.xml does not exist. Reducing the parameter to -agentpath:C:\\Users\\user~1.DOS\\SOFTWA~1\\JPROFI~1\\bin\\WINDOW~1\\jprofilerti.dll=port=8849 will work, then the JBoss VM will wait until you connect with a session of type \"Attach to JVM (local or remote)\" from JProfiler. Anyway, adding VM parameters manually is only necessary in special situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To profile without the JProfiler GUI, you use offline profiling (https://www.ej-technologies.com/resources/jprofiler/help/doc/main/offline.html). Invoke Session->Integration Wizards->New Remote Integration in the JProfiler main menu and choose the \"Profile offline\" option on the \"Startup mode\" step. You will then get the VM parameter that is required to load the profiling agent in offline mode. To record data and save snapshots, you can use triggers or the profiling API. In your case, the profiling API (https://www.ej-technologies.com/resources/jprofiler/help/api/javadoc/com/jprofiler/api/agent/Controller.html) will be more convenient. To record CPU date and save a snapshot of the entire application run, wrap your code like this: Controller.startCPURecording(true); // Your code here Controller.stopCPURecording(); Controller.saveSnapshot(new File(\"<snapshot name>.jps\"));\n",

      "The issue you're encountering with JProfiler failing to display the complete list of method invocations could be due to several reasons. Here are some possible solutions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Profiler Settings**: Check if your Profiler settings are correctly configured. Make sure that the classes you want to profile are not excluded. You can adjust these settings in the Profiler tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Idle Application**: Ensure that your application was actively running during the profiling process. If the application was idle, it might not have executed the code you intended to profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wrong JVM Profiling**: Verify that you're profiling the correct JVM. If your application involves RMI calls, ensure you're profiling the JVM where the RMI server is running.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Memory Chunk Problem**: This issue might be related to the maximum size limit for method bytecode. Adding instrumentation might exceed this limit. You can add a filter for the class to reduce this problem. In newer versions of JProfiler, you can also add the method to the list of ignored methods, which will prevent it from being instrumented at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Outdated JProfiler Version**: If you're using an older version of JProfiler, consider updating to the latest version, as this issue might have been fixed in a later release.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Environment Variable Issue**: If you're using Linux or Mac OS, ensure that the async-profiler library is on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, respectively. On Windows, you can choose another JMH profiler or add the profiler explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Manual VM Parameter Addition**: Manually adding VM parameters to a run configuration in Eclipse is not recommended for profiling with JProfiler. Instead, use the \"Quick attach\" feature or the integration wizard to avoid manual parameter addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Offline Profiling**: If you need to profile without the JProfiler GUI, consider using offline profiling. This involves using the profiling API to record CPU data and save snapshots of the entire application run.\n",

      "Check out Moving Windows (https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/moving-windows/) for a class that does this for you. It is more complicated than the basic dragging logic because it supports other features which you may not need. The basic logic (from the above class) for dragging a frame when adding the listeners to one (or more) components of the frame would be: MouseInputAdapter mia = new MouseInputAdapter() { Point location; Point pressed; public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me) { pressed = me.getLocationOnScreen(); Window window = SwingUtilities.windowForComponent(me.getComponent()); location = window.getLocation(); } public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me) { Point dragged = me.getLocationOnScreen(); int x = (int)(location.x + dragged.getX() - pressed.getX()); int y = (int)(location.y + dragged.getY() - pressed.getY()); Window window = SwingUtilities.windowForComponent(me.getComponent()); window.setLocation(x, y); } }; panel.addMouseListener(mia); panel.addMouseMotionListener(mia); Edit: Here is some more generic code that allows you to move a component directly or indirectly by specify a parent component to receive the events: import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; import javax.swing.*; import javax.swing.event.*; public class BasicComponentMover extends MouseInputAdapter { /* ** A class that allows you to drag a component around a panel. ** Optionally you can specify a \"parent\" component, in which case ** the MouseEvents will be converted to be relative to this component ** which will then be dragged.

      "If you are using a flask form to upload a file, then from flask_wtf.file import FileField can be used as the form field to upload files. class UploadImageForm(Form): file = FileField(label='File Upload') submit = SubmitField('Submit') On the HTML side you will want: <form action=\"{{ url_for(your.route, **kwargs) }}\" method=\"POST\" enctype = \"multipart/form-data\"> {{ form.name_of_file_field }} {{ form.submit }} <!-- Or an input tag --> </form> Then your route that will be called when the form is submitted must require a POST method. In development, you can store your files locally within the static folder, but I would advise to store them in remote storage before putting the app on a server. Once the file is stored and uploaded, then in your html you can render the image with: <img class=\"image\" src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename=image_file_path) }}\"> where image_file_path is the path to the image. This path should be stored as an environment variable. The image file name can be stored on your db within one of your models data columns as a string. I suggest creating UUID's as the image file name so you are not dependent on the user's upload (i.e. if the filename is in a different language). Miguel Grinberg has a great tutorial on this that will cover all of this and more including working with image objects, image validation, and security: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/handling-file-uploads-with-flask (https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/handling-file-uploads-with-flask)\n",

      "Unfortunately, the browser doesn't allow you to programmatically save files to a user's filesystem due to security concerns. Since this is going to a Flask application you should instead read the image information from the <canvas> tag and send the image information directly to the app via XHR/AJAX or a standard <form>. This is assuming that you are writing it temporarily so that Flask can read it from disk. If you absolutely have to make this work with temp files then you can get around this limitation by writing browser plugins/extensions, though in the case of chrome you will likely need the combination of both an extension and an app to get the necessary file access.\n",

      "You can save the file being uploaded by making some changes in your code as shown below. Once you have saved the file, you can deal with the file processing to store the data to MySQL.

      "To send the image data from the client to the server with Flask, you can use an HTTP POST request. In the JavaScript code, modify the saveBtn event listener to send an HTTP POST request to the server with the image data as the request body. You can use the fetch function to send the request. let saveBtn = document.querySelector(\".save\") saveBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => { let data = canvas.toDataURL(\"imag/png\") // Send an HTTP POST request to the server with the image data as the request body fetch('/save', { method: 'POST', body: data }) .then(response => { console.log(response) }) .catch(error => { console.error(error) }) }) In the Python code, add a new route to handle the POST request and save the image data to a file on the server. from flask import Flask, render_template, request import base64 app = Flask(__name__) dirweb = \"templates/\" app = Flask(__name__, template_folder=dirweb) @app.route(\"/\") def hello_world(): return render_template(\"index.html\") @app.route('/save', methods=['POST']) def save_image(): # Get the image data from the request body data = request.data # Decode the base64 encoded image data image_data = base64.b64decode(data) # Save the image data to a file with open(\"sketch.png\", \"wb\") as f: f.write(image_data) return \"Success\" if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.run(debug=False)\n",

Using HTTPBin's source, you can then see that the form section is generated from request.form. You can use that to retrieve the rest of your data. Then you can use request.files to access the image you wish to upload. The example Flask route handler would look like: @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST']) def upload_files(): resp = flask.make_response() if authenticate_user(request.form): request.files['image'].save('path/to/file.jpg') resp.status_code = 204 else: resp.status_code = 411 return resp You should read into Uploading Files (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/fileuploads/?highlight=upload%20file) documentation though.

      "To discover and link to every accessible Wi-Fi network using Python, you can utilize the `subprocess` module to execute shell commands and parse their output. Here's a step-by-step guide using the `iwlist` utility, which doesn't require elevated privileges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Import the required libraries:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import subprocess\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Execute the `iwlist` command to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "command = ['iwlist', 'wlan0','scan']\n",
      "output = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read()\n",
      "```\n",
      "Replace `'wlan0'` with the appropriate interface name if you're using a different wireless adapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Parse the output to extract relevant information such as SSID, quality, and pairwise ciphers:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "data = []\n",
      "for cell_item in output.split(\"Cell\"):\n",
      "    data_item = []\n",
      "    for line in cell_item.split(\"\\n\"):\n",

      "    if data_item:\n",
      "        data.append(data_item)\n",
      "```\n",
      "This will create a nested list structure containing the extracted data from each cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Print or process the parsed data as needed. For example, to display the SSID and quality of each network:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for network in data:\n",
      "    ssid = next((line for line in network if line.startswith(\"ESSID\")), None)\n",

      "            print(f\"Quality: {quality.split(\":\")[-1]}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this code only provides access to basic information about the detected networks. To connect to a specific network programmatically, you'll need to use additional tools and methods, possibly involving `wpa_supplicant` or similar utilities. However, connecting to networks via Python requires root privileges and careful handling of sensitive information such as passwords.\n",

      "\n",
      "You can use zip() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) inside dictionary comprehension to achieve this as: parent_list= ['emp1', 'emp2', 'emp3'] parent_keys= ['name', 'id', 'salary'] emp1_value = ['A', '100', '$10,000'] emp2_value = ['B', '101', '$9,000'] emp3_value = ['C', '102', '$9,500'] # Additional list, to hold `emp*_value` together employee_values = [ emp1_value, emp2_value, emp3_value ] my_dict = {key: dict(zip(parent_keys, employee_values[i])) for i, key in enumerate(parent_list)} where my_dict will contain your desired dict as: {'emp2': {'salary': '$9,000', 'name': 'B', 'id': '101'}, 'emp3': {'salary': '$9,500', 'name': 'C', 'id': '102'}, 'emp1': {'salary': '$10,000', 'name': 'A', 'id': '100'}}\n",

      "One way is to use zip, which iterates through i th element of each list sequentially: data = [[\"Employee\",\"Salary\",\"Age\",\"Gender\"], [\"001\",1200,25,\"M\"], [\"002\",1300,28,\"M\"], [\"003\",1400,32,\"M\"], [\"004\",1700,44,\"F\"]] d = {k: v for k, *v in zip(*data)} Unpacking via *v, as suggested by @Jean-FrançoisFabre, ensures your values are lists.

      "Do you really need a dictionary? Why not just use a namedtuple (https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple): >>> from collections import namedtuple >>> Employee = namedtuple('Employee', 'FirstName, LastName, ID') >>> names_list = [['Michael', 'Jordan', '224567'], ['Kyle', 'Hynes', '294007'], ['Josef', 'Jones', '391107']] >>> employee_list = map(Employee._make, names_list) >>> employee_list[0].FirstName 'Michael' >>> pprint(employee_list) [Employee(FirstName='Michael', LastName='Jordan', ID='224567'), Employee(FirstName='Kyle', LastName='Hynes', ID='294007'), Employee(FirstName='Josef', LastName='Jones', ID='391107')]\n",

      "Assuming there's always exactly one value in the input dict that is a list, you can find the key with the list value first, and then return a list of the current dict with that key's value replaced with each of the value recursively flattened, until the the value is no longer a dict: def flatten(d): if isinstance(d, dict): key, lst = next((k, v) for k, v in d.items() if isinstance(v, list)) return [{**d, **{key: v}} for record in lst for v in flatten(record)] else: return [d] flatten(d) returns (given the sample input dict as d): [{'company': 'A', 'employee': {'name': 'John', 'skills': 'python'}}, {'company': 'A', 'employee': {'name': 'John', 'skills': 'java'}}, {'company': 'A', 'employee': {'name': 'Mary', 'skills': 'web'}}, {'company': 'A', 'employee': {'name': 'Mary', 'skills': 'databases'}}] Or if there can be a level in the dict where there isn't a value that is a list, in which case the call to the next function with the code above would produce a StopIteration, you can catch that exception and return the input dict as is in a list, and since that's the same behavior when the input isn't a dict, you can simply catch the AttributeError exception (produced when the given object has no items attribute) too to handle both scenarios with the same handler code: def flatten(d): try: key, lst = next((k, v) for k, v in d.items() if isinstance(v, list)) except (StopIteration, AttributeError): return [d] return [{**d, **{key: v}} for record in lst for v in flatten(record)]\n",

      "Well the easiest way would be to use a defaultdict (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict). With this type of dict you can specify the default type of values, in case the key is not present. This way, you can just \"assume\" the key is present, and if it is not - a new value will be assigned automatically. So your get_emp_list_by_department can reduce all the way to be: from collections import defaultdict def get_emp_list_by_department(emp_list): emp_dict = defaultdict(list) for employee in emp_list: emp_dict[employee.department].append(employee) return emp_dict And doing get_emp_list_by_department(employee_list) with your given data will give (after changing __str__ to __repr__ for convenient printing): {'Finance': [[name: Saroj, salary: 23023232, department: Finance], [name: Amit, salary: 2323255, department: Finance], [name: Manisha, salary: 4435644, department: Finance], [name: Edwin, salary: 909898, department: Finance]], 'HR': [[name: Paul, salary: 23023232, department: HR], [name: Rose, salary: 230232, department: HR], [name: John, salary: 2302332, department: HR]], 'Security': [[name: Mathew, salary: 233354, department: Security]]} In general, even without defaultdict, all those if/elifs are not necessary. You can still just use the department dynamically, for example: def get_emp_list_by_department(emp_list): emp_dict = {} for employee in emp_list: dept = employee.department if not dept in emp_dict: emp_dict[dept] = [] emp_dict[dept].append(employee) return emp_dict\n",

      "@Mock Used to make Mockito create a mock object. @InjectMock When you want Mockito to create an instance of an object and use the mocks annotated with @Mock as its dependencies. @AutoWired Used when you want to autowire a bean from the spring context, works exactly the same as in normal code but can only be used in tests that actually creates an application context, such as tests annotated with @WebMvcTest or @SpringBootTest. @MockBean Can be used to add mock objects to the Spring application context. The mock will replace any existing bean of the same type in the application context. If no bean of the same type is defined, a new one will be added. Often used together with @SpringBootTest So normally you either: Use @Mock and @InjectMocks for running tests without a spring context, this is preferred as it's much faster. Use @SpringBootTest or @SpringMvcTest to start a spring context together with @MockBean to create mock objects and @Autowired to get an instance of class you want to test, the mockeans will be used for its autowired dependencies. You use this when writing integration tests for code that interact with a database or want to test your REST API.\n",

You can also set up your MockMvc instance within the test class constructor, and you can make your mockMvc field final if you like. In this commit (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/ee41ebc1ab77f5e0b8d956b4891e219dd6cfecf6), I updated a test class in Spring's own test suite to demonstrate some of these techniques in practice. Please note that the test class constructor does not need to be annotated with @Autowired if it accepts a single argument that is compatible with ApplicationContext.\n",
      "\n",
      "@InjectMocks is a Mockito mechanism for injecting declared fields in the test class into matching fields in the class under test. It doesn't require the class under test to be a Spring component. @Autowired is Spring's annotation for autowiring a bean into a production, non-test class. If you wanted to leverage the @Autowired annotations in the class under test, another approach would be to use springockito (https://github.com/springockito/springockito) which allows you to declare mock beans so that they will be autowired into the class under test the same way that Spring would autowire the bean. But typically that's not necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the mocks initialization, using the runner or the MockitoAnnotations.initMocks are strictly equivalent solutions. From the javadoc of the MockitoJUnitRunner (https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.2.28/org/mockito/junit/MockitoJUnitRunner.html) : JUnit 4.5 runner initializes mocks annotated with Mock, so that explicit usage of MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(Object) is not necessary. Mocks are initialized before each test method. The first solution (with the MockitoAnnotations.initMocks) could be used when you have already configured a specific runner (SpringJUnit4ClassRunner for example) on your test case. The second solution (with the MockitoJUnitRunner) is the more classic and my favorite. The code is simpler. Using a runner provides the great advantage of automatic validation of framework usage (https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.2.28/org/mockito/Mockito.html#validateMockitoUsage()) (described by @David Wallace (https://stackoverflow.com/users/1081110/david-wallace) in this answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10806345/runwithmockitojunitrunner-class-vs-mockitoannotations-initmocksthis/10812752#10812752)). Both solutions allows to share the mocks (and spies) between the test methods. Coupled with the @InjectMocks (http://docs.mockito.googlecode.com/hg/latest/org/mockito/InjectMocks.html), they allow to write unit tests very quickly. The boilerplate mocking code is reduced, the tests are easier to read. For example: @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) public class ArticleManagerTest { @Mock private ArticleCalculator calculator; @Mock(name = \"database\") private ArticleDatabase dbMock; @Spy private UserProvider userProvider = new ConsumerUserProvider(); @InjectMocks private ArticleManager manager; @Test public void shouldDoSomething() { manager.initiateArticle(); verify(database).addListener(any(ArticleListener.class)); } @Test public void shouldDoSomethingElse() { manager.finishArticle(); verify(database).removeListener(any(ArticleListener.class)); } } Pros: The code is minimal Cons: Black magic. IMO it is mainly due to the @InjectMocks annotation. With this annotation \"you loose the pain of code\" (see the great comments of @Brice (https://stackoverflow.com/users/48136/brice)) The third solution is to create your mock on each test method. It allow as explained by @mlk (https://stackoverflow.com/users/157672/mlk) in its answer to have \"self contained test\". public class ArticleManagerTest { @Test public void shouldDoSomething() { // given ArticleCalculator calculator = mock(ArticleCalculator.class); ArticleDatabase database = mock(ArticleDatabase.class); UserProvider userProvider = spy(new ConsumerUserProvider()); ArticleManager manager = new ArticleManager(calculator, userProvider, database); // when manager.initiateArticle(); // then verify(database).addListener(any(ArticleListener.class)); } @Test public void shouldDoSomethingElse() { // given ArticleCalculator calculator = mock(ArticleCalculator.class); ArticleDatabase database = mock(ArticleDatabase.class); UserProvider userProvider = spy(new ConsumerUserProvider()); ArticleManager manager = new ArticleManager(calculator, userProvider, database); // when manager.finishArticle(); // then verify(database).removeListener(any(ArticleListener.class)); } } Pros: You clearly demonstrate how your api works (BDD...) Cons: there is more boilerplate code. (The mocks creation) My recommandation is a compromise. Use the @Mock annotation with the @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class), but do not use the @InjectMocks : @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) public class ArticleManagerTest { @Mock private ArticleCalculator calculator; @Mock private ArticleDatabase database; @Spy private UserProvider userProvider = new ConsumerUserProvider(); @Test public void shouldDoSomething() { // given ArticleManager manager = new ArticleManager(calculator, userProvider, database); // when manager.initiateArticle(); // then verify(database).addListener(any(ArticleListener.class)); } @Test public void shouldDoSomethingElse() { // given ArticleManager manager = new ArticleManager(calculator, userProvider, database); // when manager.finishArticle(); // then verify(database).removeListener(any(ArticleListener.class)); } } Pros: You clearly demonstrate how your api works (How my ArticleManager is instantiated). No boilerplate code. Cons: The test is not self contained, less pain of code\n",
      "\n",
      "They both achieve the same result. Using an annotation (@Mock) is usually considered \"cleaner\", as you don't fill up your code with boilerplate assignments that all look the same. Note that in order to use the @Mock annotation, your test class should be annotated with @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) or contain a call to MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) in its @Before method.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mock object is an instance of a dynamically created class that extends the class being mocked. The class being mocked has fields annotated with @Autowired. So Spring is supposed to autowire these fields. But it can't because the beans to autowire don't exist, hence the exception. There is no reason to load a Spring context to implement a unit test. Just use Mockito without Spring: @InjectMocks private Subject subject; @Mock private AutowireInTest mockAutowizeInTest; @Before public void prepare() { MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); } Iy fou used constructor injection, the problem you're facing would become obvious, because the dependencies wouldbe explicit, and you wouldn't need the annotation support of Mockito: AutowireInTest mockAutowireInTest = mock(AutowireInTest.class); Subject subject = new Subject(mockAutowireInTest); Regarding your second question: the est would fail later if it went until there. But it can't go until there because it can't even create the beans referenced in the context.\n",

      "If you want to use mockito annotations and spring injection then: 1) Use @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) 2) Create an init method: @Before public void init(){ MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); }\n",
      "\n",
      "Say that you have the following class: @Service public class MyClass { @Autowired private BeanFactory beanFactory; /* * Some more code */ } And then you want to create some unit tests for that class, such as this: @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) public class MyClassTest { @MockBean private BeanFactory beanFactoryMock; @Autowired private MyClass myClass; @Test public void testMyClass() { // Since we have annotated our BeanFactory with @MockBean // this is now the instance that will be used by our class-under-test Mockito.when(beanFactoryMock.getBean(Warning_Log.class)) .thenReturn(...); } This is the general idea. If you have a field that is subject to dependency injection you don't have to use reflection in order to access it in your unit tests. The MockBean annotation will tell the IoC container to use your mocked class wherever it is being injected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I am not sure if I really understand your question :P I will try to clarify as much as I can, from what I get from your original question: First, in most case, you should NOT have any concern on Spring. You rarely need to have spring involved in writing your unit test. In normal case, you only need to instantiate the system under test (SUT, the target to be tested) in your unit test, and inject dependencies of SUT in the test too. The dependencies are usually a mock/stub. Your original suggested way, and example 2, 3 is precisely doing what I am describing above. In some rare case (like, integration tests, or some special unit tests), you need to create a Spring app context, and get your SUT from the app context. In such case, I believe you can: 1) Create your SUT in spring app ctx, get reference to it, and inject mocks to it @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(\"test-app-ctx.xml\") public class FooTest { @Autowired @InjectMocks TestTarget sut; @Mock Foo mockFoo; @Before /* Initialized mocks */ public void setup() { MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); } @Test public void someTest() { // .... } } or 2) follow the way described in your link Spring Integration Tests, Creating Mock Objects (http://www.jayway.com/2011/11/30/spring-integration-tests-part-i-creating-mock-objects/). This approach is to create mocks in Spring's app context, and you can get the mock object from the app ctx to do your stubbing/verification: @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(\"test-app-ctx.xml\") public class FooTest { @Autowired TestTarget sut; @Autowired Foo mockFoo; @Test public void someTest() { // .... } } Both ways should work. The main difference is the former case will have the dependencies injected after going through spring's lifecycle etc. (e.g. bean initialization), while the latter case is injected beforehands. For example, if your SUT implements spring's InitializingBean, and the initialization routine involves the dependencies, you will see the difference between these two approach. I believe there is no right or wrong for these 2 approaches, as long as you know what you are doing. Just a supplement, @Mock, @Inject, MocktoJunitRunner etc are all unnecessary in using Mockito. They are just utilities to save you typing the Mockito.mock(Foo.class) and bunch of setter invocations.\n",
      "\n",
      "JUnit is a testing framework that is independent of Spring. This means tests by default don't use Spring. JUnit uses a Runner (http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/runner/Runner.html) to run tests. The class level annotation @RunWith tells JUnit that it should run the tests with a specific Runner instead of the default BlockJUnit4ClassRunner. (http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/runners/BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.html) For example @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) adds additional features to JUnit that are helpful for testing Spring applications. For most tests you don't need a specific runner. The default runner provides enough features for most tests. The annotations @Mock and @InjectMocks are also not part of Spring. They belong to the mocking framework Mockito (http://site.mockito.org/). Mockito provides three ways of using them: MockitoRule Add a MockitoRule (https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.9.0/org/mockito/junit/MockitoRule.html) to your test. public class ExampleTest { @Mock private YourClass something; @InjectMocks private AnotherClass sut; @Rule public final MockitoRule mockito = MockitoJUnit.rule(); @Test public void shouldDoSomething() { //test code } } Explicit initialization Initialize the mocks in a @Before method with MockitoAnnotations#initMocks (https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.9.0/org/mockito/MockitoAnnotations.html). public class ExampleTest { @Mock private YourClass something; @InjectMocks private AnotherClass sut; @Before public void initMocks() { MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); } @Test public void shouldDoSomething() { //test code } } MockitoJUnitRunner Run your tests with the MockitoJUnitRunner (https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.9.0/org/mockito/junit/MockitoJUnitRunner.html). The runner has the disadvantage that there could only by one Runner and therefore you cannot combine it with another Runner. @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class) public class ExampleTest { @Mock private YourClass something; @InjectMocks private AnotherClass sut; @Test public void shouldDoSomething() { //test code } }\n",

      "There are several ways to determine the usage of Mock in a Spring Boot application:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using `@Mock`**: This annotation is used to instruct Mockito to create a mock object for a particular interface or class. It's typically used in combination with `@InjectMocks` when running tests without a Spring context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`@InjectMocks`**: This annotation is used in conjunction with `@Mock` to inject the mocked objects into the class under test. It's particularly useful when the class under test has dependencies that need to be mocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **`@Autowired`**: This annotation is used to autowire a bean from the Spring context into a test class. It works similarly to how it does in regular Spring code but is only applicable in tests that create an application context, such as those annotated with `@WebMvcTest` or `@SpringBootTest`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **`@MockBean`**: This annotation is used to add mock objects to the Spring application context. If a bean of the same type already exists, it replaces it; otherwise, a new one is added. It's often used alongside `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Running tests with `@SpringBootTest` or `@WebMvcTest`**: These annotations start a Spring context and allow you to use `@MockBean` to create mock objects and `@Autowired` to get instances of classes you want to test. This approach is used for integration tests involving databases or REST APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Initialization methods**: You can initialize mocks in a `@Before` method using `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this)`. This is a common approach when using JUnit Jupiter with the SpringExtension.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **MockitoJUnitRunner**: This runner initializes mocks annotated with `@Mock`, so explicit usage of `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(Object)` is not necessary. It's the more classic and preferred solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Creating mocks in test methods**: You can create mocks for each test method, which allows for \"self-contained\" tests but results in more boilerplate code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each approach has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of your tests, such as whether you're writing unit tests or integration tests, and whether you prefer a cleaner code structure or more explicit control over test setup.\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use format() to format your output according to your need.. for(int i=1; i<13; i++){ for(int j=1; j<13; j++){ System.out.format(\"%5d\", i * j); } System.out.println(); // To move to the next line. } Or, you can also use: - System.out.print(String.format(\"%5d\", i * j)); in place of System.out.format.. Here's is the explanation of how %5d works: - First, since we are printing integer, we should use %d which is format specifier for integers.. 5 in %5d means the total width your output will take.. So, if your value is 5, it will be printed to cover 5 spaces like this: - ****5 %5d is used to align right.. For aligning left, you can use %-5d. For a value 5, this will print your output as: - 5****\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use System.out.format() or System.out.printf() (printf internally simply invokes format so both methods give same results). Below you will find example which will align text to left and fill unused places with spaces. Aligning String to left can be achieved with %-15s, which means: % reserve (placeholder) 15 \"places\" for characters s of String data-type - and start printing them from left. If you want to handle digits use d suffix like %-4d to reserve minimum 4 \"spaces\", number will be printed from left side of that \"column\". BTW printf doesn't automatically add line separators after printed data, so if we want to move cursor to next line we need to do it ourselves. We can use \\r or \\n, or let Formatter generate OS dependent line separator (like for Windows \\r\\n) with %n (note: this \"placeholder\" doesn't require any data as arguments, Java will provide correct sequence based on OS). You can find more info about supported syntax at documentation of Formatter class (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Formatter.html#syntax).

You can use either of them.. You can also store your formatted string into a String variable by using String.format(), and you can later print that string variable: - String result = String.format(\"%3d * %4d = %5d\\n\", numberLoop, num_input, result) NOTE: - For more formatting options, you can go through documentation of Formatter (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html) class..\n",

      "\n",
      "To align the results with the desired output in Java programming, you can use the `System.out.format()` or `System.out.printf()` methods along with format specifiers. These methods allow you to control the formatting and alignment of your output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points to consider when aligning output:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Alignment Specifiers:**\n",
      "   - `%-width`: Left-align the output within the specified width.\n",
      "   - `%width`: Right-align the output within the specified width.\n",
      "   - `%widthd` or `%widthD`: Right-align decimal integers within the specified width.\n",
      "   - `%ws` or `%wS`: Left-align strings within the specified width.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Width Specification:**\n",
      "   - The number before the specifier indicates the minimum width of the output.\n",
      "   - If the actual output is shorter than the specified width, it will be padded with spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Example Usage:**\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   String leftAlignFormat = \"| %-15s | %-4d |%n\";\n",
      "   \n",

      "   \n",
      "   System.out.format(\"+-----------------+------+%n\");\n",

      "   +-----------------+------+\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using `String.format()`:**\n",
      "   You can also use `String.format()` to create a formatted string and then print it:\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   String formattedString = String.format(\"| %-15s | %-4d |%n\", \"some data\", 5);\n",
      "   System.out.print(formattedString);\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In React, all components must have a single root element. This means that if you want to display a React component that includes an unclosed tag, you need to ensure that there's only one top-level element. If you're seeing errors like \"Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag,\" it's likely due to trying to return multiple elements without a container.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how you can fix this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use a Single Root Element**: Ensure that each `return` statement in your `render` method contains exactly one top-level JSX element. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```jsx\n",
      "   render() {\n",
      "     return (\n",
      "       <div>\n",
      "         <h1>Welcome to React</h1>\n",
      "       </div>\n",
      "     );\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Nested Components**: If you have nested components, they should be properly closed within their parent component. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```jsx\n",
      "   render() {\n",
      "     return (\n",
      "       <div>\n",
      "         <h1>Welcome to React</h1>\n",
      "         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n",
      "       </div>\n",
      "     );\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Handling Dynamic Content with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`**: When dealing with content that might contain HTML, use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` carefully. Wrap the entire content in a single element and ensure it's properly closed:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```jsx\n",
      "   render() {\n",
      "     const item = { text: '<strong>This is bold</strong>' }; // Example data\n",
      "\n",
      "     return (\n",
      "       <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: item.text }} />\n",
      "     );\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Self-Closing Tags**: For self-closing tags like `<br/>`, ensure they are correctly formatted:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```jsx\n",
      "   render() {\n",
      "     return (\n",
      "       <div>\n",
      "         <p>\n",
      "           Some text.\n",
      "           <br />\n",
      "           Another line.\n",
      "         </p>\n",
      "       </div>\n",
      "     );\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can avoid issues related to unclosed tags and ensure your React components render correctly.\n",

      "This solution is not ideal, because : this will only remove the excessive datas from the json. Hibernate will do the same request and this risks to slow down your application. Not a good practise to set a jackson annotation (@JsonManagedReference) in a java entity. ==> You probably have to change relation-type For the bidirectional one-to-one relationship this kind of annotation worked for me:- @Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor @ToString @Entity public class A { @Id @GeneratedValue private long aId; String name; String address; @JsonManagedReference // this for parent to avoid infinite recursion @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL) @JoinColumn(name = \"b_id_FK\") // B table foreign key in A table B b; } @Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor @ToString @Entity public class B { @Id @GeneratedValue @Column(name = \"b_id_PK\") private long bId; private String name; private String address; @NotNull @JsonBackReference // this for child to avoid infinite recursion @JoinColumn(name = \"a_id_FK\") // A table foreign key in B table @JsonIgnoreProperties({\"hibernateLazyInitializer\", \"handler\"}) @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL) private A a; } This way I can have foreign key in both A and B table.

      "What you want to achieve is totally doable, but requires several changes. I split my answer into 2 parts: Save the students There are several problems with saving: On POST your incoming json deserialized into objects in which Classe has a reference to Anuli, but Anuli doesn't have a reference toClasse. To check it you can add a break point at the line: return new ResponseEntity<>(... , run in debug mode and check fields of Anuli in Classe. To fix it you can add @JsonManagedReference on aluni field in Classe. Related question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37392733/difference-between-jsonignore-and-jsonbackreference-jsonmanagedreference#37394318) Hibernate can't save referenced objects by default. You have to save them one by one after saving your Classe object or just turn on Cascade persisting. Related question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18454058/hibernate-automatically-persist-dependant-objects) So, to fix 1 and 2 Classe should have: @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"classe\", cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST) @JsonManagedReference private Set<Aluno> alunos = new HashSet<Aluno>(); You have to remove custom id generation in Alumi (I am talking about static int tempID). Annotation @GeneratedValue will perfectly generate id for you as soon as you persist an object. This custom generation breaks Hibernate support. I even not talking about that it also breaks the app after restart, not threadsafe etc. Return id only On POST returned json represent what was returned in classeRepo.saveAndFlush(classe) so it's an object of Classe. If you want to return exactly this: { \"id_classe\": 101 } Then create new class like this: public class ClasseIdVO { @JsonProperty(\"id_casse\") private Integer id; // Constructors, getter, setter VO - means View Object, so this object only for representation, not for persisting, etc. You can use field name id_casse, but it's against Java code convention, so better add @JsonProperty. Also change your saving code to new ClasseIdVO(classeRepo.saveAndFlush(classe).getId()) Or you can just return id as a number: classeRepo.saveAndFlush(classe).getId()\n",

No, vice versa!:) ...for the @OneToMany, you should find the join columns \"on the other side\" (of relationship(s)). According to your JSON, it is OneToMany.

What is missing is a way to tell the object mapper about the one to many relationship, only then it will create parent and child objects properly upon which hibernate handles the rest of the stuff. Luckily Jackson has two annotations @JsonManagedReference, @JsonBackReference to tell the object mapper about the relationship.

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Your implementation is totally wrong, that is not how you suppose to write parent and child class. either define name in parent class or child class, if you define it in a parent class then you can't define again in the child because new field will be created instead. so if you want to change max_length in the child, then I would recommend that you declare name in the child so that any class that inherits from node will set its own name with its own max_length. the correct implementation is class Node(models.Model): #other class attributes child class should inherit parent attributes and add its own stuff. class Thingy(Node): name = models.CharField(max_length=100) otherstuff = models.CharField(max_length=255) now when you query, you only get one name instead of the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "From docs (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/db/models/#meta-options): Model metadata is “anything that’s not a field”, such as ordering options (ordering), database table name (db_table), or human-readable singular and plural names (verbose_name and verbose_name_plural). None are required, and adding class Meta to a model is completely optional. Thus, Meta is just a container class responsible for holding metadata information attached to the model. It defines such things as available permissions, associated database table name, whether the model is abstract or not, singular and plural versions of the name etc. For the available Meta options, you can take a look at here (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/options/). As for your question, I would definitely avoid changing max_length to some other value like that, as you know, max_length also creates a database constraint such as VARCHAR(64) which can't be automatically updated to a new value (100) by Django. Thus, if you want to change max length, make sure you also update the size of the column in the corresponding table column in the database: For MySQL: ALTER TABLE auth_user MODIFY username VARCHAR(100); For PostgreSQL: ALTER TABLE auth_user ALTER COLUMN username TYPE VARCHAR(100);\n",
      "\n",
      "Your custom form widget fields.field class doesn't accept a max_length argument, which models.CharField.formfield adds by default (when you call super().formfield(**defaults)). Either you add an __init__ to your field class which accepts (and perhaps simply discards) the max_length argument. Or have your field class inherit from forms.fields.CharField instead of forms.fields.Field. Alternatively you completely override the formfield method to not add that argument. Which means you basically need to bypass the models.CharField.formfield implementation and call models.Field.formfield directly: def formfield(self, **kwargs): defaults = {'form_class': fields.field} defaults.update(kwargs) return super(CharField, self).formfield(**defaults) Not necessarily the most elegant solution, as it relies on a lot of internal implementation details like the specific inheritence hierarchy, so be prepared to check whether this breaks with every Django version change.\n",

I had not used max_length in the Form (which worked without any issues) and since CharField is common to Form and Model, I tried using the field as it is. Kaboom! Fortunately, I noticed the word 'required' in the documentation. The error message and traceback were not very helpful.\n",

      "Short answer: make from max_length an explicitly named argument. Based on the source code (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/_modules/django/db/models/fields/#CharField), max_length is not an explicit parameter of CharField, it thus performs a call to the __init__ of Field (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/_modules/django/db/models/fields/#Field), and this has as arguments: def __init__(self, verbose_name=None, name=None, primary_key=False, max_length=None, unique=False, blank=False, null=False, db_index=False, rel=None, default=NOT_PROVIDED, editable=True, serialize=True, unique_for_date=None, unique_for_month=None, unique_for_year=None, choices=None, help_text='', db_column=None, db_tablespace=None, auto_created=False, validators=(), error_messages=None): So as you can see, your first unnamed parameter, actually will match with verbose_name, and this should be a string. Of course providing the number as a string will not solve the problem since then you pass the max_length to the verbose_name, instead, and furthermore max_length is, as far as I know a required parameter for CharField. The solution is to explicitly use max_length such that it is clear that you want to assign 4 to that parameter. The same holds for the DecimalField by the way: class Publisher(models.Model): publisherCode = models.CharField(max_length=3,primary_key=True) publisherName = models.CharField(max_length=25) city = models.CharField(max_length=20) class Book(models.Model): bookCode = models.CharField(max_length=4,primary_key=True) title = models.CharField(max_length=40) publisherCode = models.ForeignKey(Publisher) type = models.CharField(max_length=3) paperback = models.CharField(max_length=1) class Branch(models.Model): branchNum = models.DecimalField(max_digits=2, decimal_places=0, primary_key=True) branchName = models.CharField(max_length=50) branchLocation = models.CharField(max_length=50) class Copy(models.Model): bookCode = models.ForeignKey(Book) branchNum = models.ForeignKey(Branch) copyNum = models.DecimalField(max_digits=2, decimal_places=0, primary_key=True) quality = models.CharField(max_length=20) price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2) This is more \"self-explaining\" as well: a user with not much Django experience, can usually guess that max_length=3 means that the string can contain at most three characters, whereas without explicit naming, he/she should have to look up what exactly this parameter means. I find it rather weird that you use a DecimalField with decimal_places=0, since this is basically an IntegerField, usually it is better to use an IntegerField in that case since it maps more directly to what it is conceptually, the database can store it in a more compact way, and arithmetic operations are usually correct in integer land, whereas in floating point land, there can be rounding errors.\n",

      "In Django, if you want to modify the `max_length` attribute in a model field, you cannot do so directly within the model definition because it's a required argument for the field constructor. Instead, you need to follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define the field in the parent class with the desired initial `max_length`.\n",
      "2. In the child class, redefine the field with the new `max_length`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from django.db import models\n",
      "\n",
      "class BaseModel(models.Model):\n",
      "    base_field = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n",
      "\n",
      "class ChildModel(BaseModel):\n",
      "    child_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, `base_field` in `BaseModel` has a `max_length` of 50, but in `ChildModel`, `child_field` overrides this with a `max_length` of 100.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you try to modify the `max_length` after the model has been defined, you'll encounter an error because Django won't allow you to change the field's definition after it's been established. Therefore, you must define the field with the new `max_length` in the child class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Changing the `max_length` in a child class will also affect the database schema. Make sure to handle migrations accordingly, as you'll need to alter the column size in the database to match the new `max_length`.\n",

      "Verify whether an email belongs to a specific domain or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to do the contains-check for each item in the list separately. There is some syntactic Python sugar for this though: if any(x in email for x in domain): # good: email contains one of the domains or more to the point (of validating emails): if all(not email.endswith(x) for x in domain): # rain hellfire on user\n",
      "\n",
      "For validating emails, this depends on how specifically you want to validate them. If you just want to check that the email follows the basic x@y.tld format, then you can use a regular expression - if you want to check the domain at the same time to make sure that the mailbox can exist, then using a module is probably your best bet. pyIsEmail (https://github.com/michaelherold/pyIsEmail) is a good choice - it also has the facility to check if the domain the email address is from is real, and if it also has a valid MX record attached. from pyisemail import is_email address = \"test@example.com\" bool_result = isemail(address) bool_result_with_dns = is_email(address, check_dns=True) Flanker (https://github.com/mailgun/flanker) can also be used for this purpose - as well as checking DNS, MX records and ESP grammar for each email, it can take a list of email records and return a tuple containing lists of the valid and invalid emails. >>> from flanker.addresslib import address >>> >>> address.validate_list(['foo@mailgun.com, bar@mailgun.com, @mailgun.com'], as_tuple=True) ([foo@mailgun.com, bar@mailgun.com], ['@mailgun.com'])\n",

      "I would choose a regex based check, but if you want to use just the basic string functions, here are the requested 3 checks (no space; contains @; contains a dot after @, but not immediately after @). It allows nonsense like @@?., a regex is really much better. def check_email(string): if ' ' in string: return False if \"@\" not in string: return False name, domain = string.split('@', 1) if '.' not in domain[1:]: return False return True Note that a function is not limited to one return at its end. Look how the code becomes readable when a result is returned as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really not a fan of the regex option, especially as so many people commented on answers here, it is very hard to catch all cases. Instead, I decided to use the Python email.utils.parseaddr (http://docs.python.org/2/library/email.util.html#email.utils.parseaddr) function which will split the message \"From\" header to a tuple of (name, addr). From there, using addr.split('@') will split the e-mail address into its local part and domain part, and I can match the latter against the domain I'm verifying for. So, the answer to my question is: msg = email.message_from_string(data[0][1]) addr = email.utils.parseaddr(msg['From'])[1] domain = addr.split('@')[1] if domain == \"example.com\": print \"Verified requester\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When doing string searching/testing that gets even modestly complicated, it's usually better (more readable and more flexible) to use regular expressions (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=re#module-re). import re # from https://emailregex.com/ email_pattern = re.compile(r\"(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)\") emails = ['Hello@emuail.com', 'Hello2@emuail.comaas', 'hello--1@emuail.com'] for email in emails: if email_pattern.match(email): print(email) Note that hyphens are allowed in email addresses, but if you want to disallow them for some reason, delete them from the regular expression.\n",

So, you can do something like this server_list, good_list, bad_list = [\"gmail.com\", \"yahoo.com\"], [], [] with open(\"email.txt\") as in_file: for email_address in in_file: email_address = email_address.rstrip() if any(email_address.endswith(server) for server in server_list): bad_list.append(email_address) else: good_list.append(email_address) As per lvc's suggestion (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23338557/python-check-if-string-is-in-any-items-in-a-list/23338645?noredirect=1#comment35739171_23338645), we can actually pass a tuple of data to str.endswith (https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.endswith). So, the code can be further simplified to server_list, good_list, bad_list = (\"gmail.com\", \"yahoo.com\"), [], [] ... ... if email_address.endswith(server_list): bad_list.append(email_address) else: good_list.append(email_address)\n",

      "you could just use this: any(item[\"email\"] == \"were@mail.com\" for item in some_list) # True iterate over some_list and check if any (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any) of its items has the given email. if you need to do this check often, you could speed it up by generating a set (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=set#set) that contains the mails only and then check with in: email_set = set(item[\"email\"] for item in some_list) \"were@mail.com\" in email_set # True\n",

      "Clearly you've done some work (although in the future, try not to post a picture) and you kinda went in the right direction. First, if you are asking for input from a user, always check for input from the user. In this particular case, you are lucky, because by splitting by @ and counting the number of parts, you can tell if you have an invalid email address from the get go (This is a naïve implementation, in reality it's a little trickier than that but for your level, you can assume it's enough to decide it is a viable email) When using split, you need to capture the result (a list). You didn't do that in your example. Since we only had one @ character for a valid email, we can assume we should have 2 strings, so then it's just a case of checking the end of the second string. email = input(\"Enter your email: \") parts = email.split(\"@\") if len(parts) != 2: print(f\"{email} is not a valid email\") else: if parts[1].endswith(\".com\"): print(f\"{email} ends with .com\") else: print(f\"{email} does not end with .com\") Much easier than and less arduous than what you were going for.

After this, you just need to return the variable which contains all the properties other than the ones you want to remove. const modifiedItems = this.items.map( ({ created, removed, ...rest }) => rest ); Following code snippet shows an example: const arr = [ { removed: 1, created: 1, a:2, b: 2, c: 3}, { removed: 1, created: 1, a:2, b: 2, c: 3}, { removed: 1, created: 1, a:2, b: 2, c: 3}, ]; const modifiedItems = arr.map( ({ created, removed, ...rest }) => rest ); console.log(modifiedItems); Edit: In your case, this.items is an array that contains nested arrays. So to remove the properties from the objects inside the nested arrays, you need to map over each nested array as well. Following code snippet shows an example: const items = [ [ { removed: 1, created: 1, a: 2, b: 2, c: 3 } ], [ { removed: 1, created: 1, a: 2, b: 2, c: 3 }, { removed: 1, created: 1, a: 2, b: 2, c: 3} ] ]; const modifiedItems = items.map(subArr => { return subArr.map(({ created, removed, ...rest }) => rest) }); console.log(modifiedItems);\n",

      "I want to move the turtle Up/going forward. Any suggestions? I believe that @jasonharper's advice is the best, \"You need to actually set the turtle's new position, just like you did in the left/right functions.\" We just need to copy the logic of the horizontal motion and apply it to the vertical: from turtle import Screen, Turtle playerSpeed = 30 # Move the player def move_left(): x = player.xcor() - playerSpeed if x < -280: x = - 280 player.setx(x) def move_right(): x = player.xcor() + playerSpeed if x > 280: x = 280 player.setx(x) def move_up(): y = player.ycor() + playerSpeed if y > 280: y = 280 player.sety(y) # Create Player Turtle player = Turtle() player.shape('triangle') player.color('green') player.speed('fastest') player.setheading(90) player.penup() player.setposition(0, -250) # Create keyboard bindings screen = Screen() screen.setup(600, 600) screen.onkey(move_left, 'Left') screen.onkey(move_right, 'Right') screen.onkey(move_up, 'Up') screen.listen() screen.mainloop() Defining things like the size of the screen helps visualize your limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the screen.tracer() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.tracer) method by setting it to 0. With that you'll also need to update the screen every time the turtle makes a move: from turtle import Turtle, Screen def move_right(): turtle.setheading(0) turtle.forward(25) screen.update() def move_up(): turtle.setheading(90) turtle.forward(25) screen.update() def move_left(): turtle.setheading(180) turtle.forward(25) screen.update() def move_down(): turtle.setheading(270) turtle.forward(25) screen.update() turtle = Turtle() screen = Screen() screen.tracer(0) screen.onkeypress(move_right, \"Right\") screen.onkeypress(move_up, \"Up\") screen.onkeypress(move_left, \"Left\") screen.onkeypress(move_down, \"Down\") screen.listen() screen.exitonclick() You can also use lambda functions to shorten your code: from turtle import Turtle, Screen def f(num): turtle.setheading(num) turtle.forward(25) screen.Screen.update() turtle = Turtle() screen = Screen() screen.tracer(0) screen.onkeypress(lambda: f(0), \"Right\") screen.onkeypress(lambda: f(90), \"Up\") screen.onkeypress(lambda: f(180), \"Left\") screen.onkeypress(lambda: f(270), \"Down\") screen.listen() screen.exitonclick() Do note that it's not optimal to name your Turtle object turtle, as it can be confused as the turtle module.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use turtle's built in key event handlers. This is the link to the documents: https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/turtle.html (https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/turtle.html) Using your code, everything stays the same up to tankCursor() (line 98). Now going down in order, this is what I did. tankCursor() # creates and registers the \"tank\" cursor shape tank = turtle tank.shape(\"tank\") turtle.up() # get rid of the ink screen = turtle.Screen() I made the tank variable so you are interacting with that (you did turtle.foward, turtle.backward, etc.) instead of turtle. Just good practice, and now you can have multiple tanks on the screen, or multiple characters if you wish. The turtle.up() is from your original code. The screen = turtle.Screen() is so your code gets notified of the key events, ie. when the user clicks a key / releases a key. def moveright(): tank.forward(40) def moveleft(): tank.backward(40) These are just functions, to move the tank right and left. Notice I used tank.forward, not turtle.forward. This corresponds to the tank = turtle variable above. The name 'tank' can be anything you want, just make sure you use that name all the way through your code. The .forward and .backward functions are the same type you used in while True: turtle.forward(100) turtle.left(90) turtle.forward(100) turtle.left(180) turtle.forward(200) all of those should work in the moveright / moveleft functions as well. screen.onkeypress(moveright, \"Right\") screen.onkeypress(moveleft, \"Left\") screen.listen() screen.mainloop() Now is the magic. The 2 screen.onkeypress lines tell the computer to listen for a pressed key. It takes 2 arguments, the first is a function (that is what the moveright, moveleft parts are) and the second argument is a string relating to the desired key on the keyboard. Eg. 'e' -> 'e' key, 'w' -> letter w, -> 'Up' -> up arrow -> 'Right' -> right arrow, so on, so forth. **The key names must be in quotes, like in the example above. if you do screen.onkeypress(moveright, Right) it will throw an error. The screen.listen() tells the computer to start listing for the key events, and the screen.mainloop starts Turtle's mainloop so it continues to look until turtle.done() is called. The screen.mainloop is very important because without it your program would end and no events would be received. Here is the full code, feel free to copy / paste and use it however you wish. Again, code continues from tankCursor(), line 98. tankCursor() # creates and registers the \"tank\" cursor shape tank = turtle tank.shape(\"tank\") turtle.up() # get rid of the ink screen = turtle.Screen() def moveright(): tank.forward(40) def moveleft(): tank.backward(40) screen.onkeypress(moveright, \"Right\") screen.onkeypress(moveleft, \"Left\") screen.listen() screen.mainloop()\n",

      "The solution is suggested by dhke (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#classmethod) in the comments of the original question: common_method() needs an object, but you are still in the class declaration. Has common_method() any other use? Because then you could just make it a class method (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#classmethod) and refer to it by Sample.common_method() Applying it into the code would be better, I think: class Sample(object): tp = 4 dp = 4.2 por = 0.007 @classmethod def common_method(self, arg1, arg2) return self.tp - arg1 * arg2 class SampleA(Sample) arg1 = 0.1 arg2 = 2 arg3 = Sample.common_method(arg1, arg2) # 3.8 class SampleB(Sample): . . .

In the constructor of summary_stats_class, we set the parameter list to self.data variable. We then calculated the min, max, and mean of the data and set them to self.min_data, self.max_data, and self.mean_data respectively. We set them to self so that these variables can be used from any other methods of the class. In the get_summary_stats, min_max_scale, and zscore_scale method, we used the previously calculated variables using self.VARIABLE_NAME.

      "\n",
      "The `AttributeError:'str' object has no attribute 'get'` typically occurs when you're trying to access attributes on a string object, which doesn't support such operations. In the context of Django views, this usually happens due to incorrect usage of the `__str__` method in your models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ensure you've defined the `__str__` method in your model. This method should return a string representing the object. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from django.db import models\n",
      "\n",
      "class MyModel(models.Model):\n",
      "    field1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
      "    field2 = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",

      "    def __str__(self):\n",
      "        return f\"{self.field1} - {self.field2}\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, `__str__` returns a string concatenation of `field1` and `field2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If you're still encountering issues, ensure that you're not accidentally returning a string literal instead of calling a method or accessing an attribute on the object. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def my_view(request):\n",
      "    obj = MyModel.objects.get(pk=1)  # Assuming pk=1 exists\n",
      "    return HttpResponse(str(obj))  # This is correct\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid doing this:\n",
      "\n",

      "def my_view(request):\n",
      "    obj = MyModel.objects.get(pk=1)  # Assuming pk=1 exists\n",
      "    return HttpResponse(\"This is incorrect\")  # Don't do this\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lastly, remember that Django uses the `__str__` method in several places, including displaying objects in the Django admin and rendering templates. Therefore, always return a human-readable, meaningful representation of your model object in the `__str__` method.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The only time I've run into falling afoul of the circular dependency issue was in a similar project with many smallish modules that all worked together. The answer was to not import any names from the imported modules into the current module namespace, but to use fully qualified references to the other modules. So, instead of: from foo import Foo,Foobar from bar import Bar,Barbaz class Zuul(Foo): def do_something(self): self.bar = Bar() self.baz = Barbaz() Do this instead: import foo import bar class Zuul(foo.Foo): def do_something(self): self.bar = bar.Bar() self.baz = bar.Barbaz() Python tries to get around the circular import problem by only importing each module once. But, if you assign names from those imported modules into your module, then it has to try to obey an order, which it can't for circular imports. Using the fully-qualified names seems to sidestep the issue. It's more typing, but much safer.\n",

      "\n",
      "Managing classes with circular dependencies in Python can be challenging due to Python's import system, which attempts to import each module only once. Here are several strategies to handle such situations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fully Qualified References**: As mentioned in the context, using fully qualified names (e.g., `bar.Bar()` instead of `from bar import Bar`) helps avoid issues related to circular dependencies. This approach is straightforward and ensures that no direct imports between the modules occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import foo\n",
      "   import bar\n",

      "           self.bar = bar.Bar()\n",
      "           self.baz = bar.Barbaz()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Import within Methods/Functions**: You can defer the import until it's actually needed inside methods or functions. This strategy avoids the need for mutual imports at the top level.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   class Zuul(Foo):\n",
      "       def do_something(self):\n",
      "           from.bar import Bar, Barbaz  # Import within method\n",
      "           self.bar = Bar()\n",
      "           self.baz = Barbaz()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use a Singleton or Factory Pattern**: Implement a singleton or factory pattern to create instances of the dependent classes without causing a circular import.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   class BarSingleton:\n",
      "       _instance = None\n",

      "           self.baz = Barbaz()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dependency Injection**: Pass the required objects as arguments when creating an instance of the class with the circular dependency.\n",

      "   ```python\n",
      "   class Zuul(Foo):\n",

      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll have to stick with the if statement, but it can be simplified: for x in my_list: doSomething() if not my_list: print \"my_list is empty\" since my_list is empty, the for loop never executes the loop portion, and an empty list is False in a boolean context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following is invalid syntax: print item in mylist if item is not \"\" You could perhaps achieve what you want using a list comprehension: >>> mylist = [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"\",\"baz\"] >>> print [item for item in mylist if item] ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\n",
      "\n",
      "Both print ('foo here!') and print ('bar here!') are not executed because the boolean expressions name == foo and name == bar are evaluated to false in most cases. For instance, in the boolean expression name == foo under the definition foo(), the first element of the list name is compared with foo. foo returns a friendly string representation of the object function foo() (usually used for debugging purposes). You can actually try and print foo() by executing print(foo) and assign the returned value to the list name in foo() (in my case its <function foo at 0x7fad58f35d40> – it will probably be different in your machine). This will evaluate name == foo to true and hence will result in print ('foo here!') being executed. That being said, here is how for loop works (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_for_loop.htm): The first element in your name list is assigned to the item variable. Next, the body of the for loop is executed. After the body is executed, the second element in the list name is assigned to the variable item before the body of the for loop is executed again. This process continues until there are no more elements in the name list. Now in order for say print('foo here!') to be executed, the boolean expression in your if statement has to be evaluated to true. Here is an example where print('foo here!') will execute when the user types foo after running the program. def foo(): name = input('>>').lower().split() for item in name: if item == 'foo': print('foo here!') else: bar() def bar(): name = input('>>').lower().split() for item in name: if item == 'bar': print('bar here!') print('Welcome Home') foo() In the definition foo(), the first element of the list name is compared with the string (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm) foo, thus the condition if name == 'foo' is met.

File \"C:\\Users\\davel\\Desktop\\Python\\Test Code\\numpy.py\", line 2, in <module> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt You have imported numpy, and it is located at \"C:\\Users\\davel\\Desktop\\Python\\Test Code\\numpy.py\". Note though that this is not the numpy package you're looking for, you have imported your own file which is named numpy! The solution to your problem is to rename your file numpy.py to something else. When python tries to find the module, it first looks at the files in the current directory, and if it finds a numpy it happily imports it. This is also known as \"shadowing\".\n",

      "\n",
      "As explained in the python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), a \"module is a file containing Python definitions and statements [and the] file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.\" So by naming your file numpy.py, and then trying to import numpy in that module, you have two different imports of numpy. You never want to give a script the same name as a common module, such as pandas, numpy, or anything in the standard library. Instead, rename the script file to numpy_examples.py or something like it, and it should solve your problem.\n",

      "Actually, you kind of screwed your pip setup. Start with the beginning : $ python -m pip list What is returned by this command ? I would suggest you start using virtual environment (venv). It is much easier to handle module dependency issues in the future. $ python -m venv /path/to/env $ source /path/to/env/bin/activate # Activates your environment $ python -m pip install numpy $ python run.py Doing so will gather all your dependencies in /path/to/env without messing up with your global setup.\n",

      "### QUESTION:\n",
      "Eliminate all shopping cart products via a button on a personalized webpage utilizing AJAX.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you may be after something like this. Since you didn't post any html I can only assume your button has the ID of cart-add and the form you want in question is let's say 'myForm'. This will bind the click of that button and prevent its default action and perform an ajax post of the form's data you have filled out. Hope this helps. $('#cart-add').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); var $formData = $('#myform').serialize(); $.ajax({ url: 'yoururl', type: 'POST', data: $formData, success: function(response) { // do stuff. } }); });\n",
      "\n",
      "if your button is <button id='deleteButton' >Click</button> $('#deleteButton').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault();// for not publish form $.ajax({ url:'clearDatabase.php', dataType:\"json\", data:{data:data}, type:'POST', success:function(data){ if(data==\"0\"){ alert(\"stuff deleted\"); location.reload();//here you reload the page after the user close the alert } }, complete: function(XMLHttpRequest, status) { location.reload(); } }); });\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, you're getting the serialize is not a function error because you're calling it on a string. It's intended to be called on a form element contained within a jQuery object. Secondly, you need to append the value of the clicked button to the querystring which is generated from the serialize() method. Lastly, to stop the form submission in the correct manner you should hook the event to the form element itself. Try this: $(\"form\").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); var $form = $(this); var action = $form.find('.send').val(); $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: \"ajax.php\", data: $form.serialize() + '&action=' + action, // data: $form.serialize() + '&' + $.param({ action: action }) // alternative success: function(data) { $('#response').html(data); } }); });\n",
      "\n",
      "You should get your cart when you do the update. If the cart is empty you can return that in your ajax response. For example by setting an emptyCart key in your array: function removeCart(key) { $.ajax({ url: 'index.php?route=checkout/cart/update', type: 'post', data: 'remove=' + key, dataType: 'json', success: function(json) { $('.success, .warning, .attention, .information').remove(); if (json['emptyCart']) { location.href=\"/where-you-want-it-to-go\"; } if (json['output']) { $('#cart_total').html(json['total']); $(\"table.total tr:last td:last\").text(json['total'].split('-')[1]); $('#cart .content').html(json['output']); } } }); }\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget to add an event.preventDefault() line to avoid having the browser perform the default behavior, which is reloading page on submit. Try something like $(\"#PostItemz\").on('submit', function(event){ event.preventDefault() var formData = new FormData(this); $.ajax({ url: 'inc/modules/post_data.php', type: 'POST', data: formData, success: function (data) { alert(data); }, cache: false, contentType: false, processData: false }); }); This should at least solve the reload issue. Also, if you want to target the form, use submit event: $(\"#form_id\").on('submit', function() {//do stuff}) . If you want to target the button in itself, then you can do $(\"#button_id\").on('click', function() {//do stuff}) but for a form I'd advise the first solution. EDIT: If you place your code in the head, it loads before the rest of the page, thus tries to bind to an ID that does not exists (at the time of processing the script). To avoid this, you should either: place the code at the end of the body, just before the </body> tag use a $(function() {//stuff}) (shortened for of the $(document).on('ready', function() {//do stuff}) ) to wrap up your jquery code, essentially telling the browser: \"wait for the full page to load before executing this script\" The later translates as the following code in your case: $(function() { $(\"#PostItemz\").on('submit', function(event){ event.preventDefault() var formData = new FormData(this); $.ajax({ url: 'inc/modules/post_data.php', type: 'POST', data: formData, success: function (data) { alert(data); }, cache: false, contentType: false, processData: false }); }); });\n",
      "\n",
      "There is more than one issue with your code, so I will explain why to you in detail. If you are sending trough POST, send the data. The first issue I saw was that you ain't sending nothing with the AJAX request. To send specific data, use the data property: $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: '/cart', data: $(this).serialize(), // Call the form values as a string success: function(data) { console.log(data); $(\"#cart-template\").html(data) } }) But, what is this? Handle form submit from the form itself. This means that don't wait until the submit button is pressed. To give your JavaScript code a better context of your app, handle the form submit to start working: $(\"#purchaseform\").submit(function(event){ ... }) So, #purchaseform should be your form tag. Handling the form like this, will let you use this to reference the actual form that was submitted. That's why we used: $(this).serialize(). Decide what type of data structure you will use. As I saw in your code, you are supposedly sending dataTyoe: \"json\", but later on you are using the output of your AJAX request and appending it as HTML. So, the simplest way if you want to return HTML from the AJAX request, remove the dataType property, so your code would look like this: $(\"#purchaseform\").submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault() $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: '/cart', data: $(this).serialize(), success: function(data) { console.log(data); $(\"#cart-template\").html(data) } }) }) Here is a LIVE DEMO (https://jsfiddle.net/k3llydev/gkudpsz5/) so you can try different things around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "<form id=\"sendData\" action=\"sendData.php\" method=\"post\"> <button type=\"submit\" name=\"send\" onclick=\"sendAjax()\">Send</button> </form> You're running the JS when you click a submit button in a form. So the JS runs, then the browser immediately navigates to a new page (submitting the form, with no data in it, to the PHP) and the XMLHttpRequest object is destroyed before it receives a response. You then see the result of the standard form submission. If you just want a button to trigger some JavaScript, then use a non-submit button (<button type=\"button\"), and don't put it in a form. Better yet: switch away from onclick attributes (they have a variety of issues) in favour of addEventListener (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) providing a submit event listener on the form Use preventDefault() (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) to stop the form submission when the JS is successful Put form controls in the form so it submits useful data when the JS isn't successful i.e. write Unobtrusive JavaScript (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript) then provides Progressive enhancement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement).\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "To catch the submit event and call ajax instead of submit form use $(\"#form\").submit(function () { var dt = $(this).serialize(); $.post('data.php',dt,function(data) { }); return false; }); Thanks @dfsq for the improvements UPDATE: see this JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/er5x4jb5/2/) for a working ajax submit\n",

      "To np.array, your list of lists of tuples isn't any different from a list of lists of lists. It's iterables all the way down. np.array tries to create as high a dimensional array as possible. In this case that is 3d. There are ways of side stepping that and making a 2d array that contains objects, where those objects are things like tuples. But as noted in the comments, why would you want that? In a recent SO question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49064548/force-numpy-to-create-array-of-objects), I came up with this way of turning a n-d array into an object array of (n-m)-d shape: In [267]: res = np.empty((3,2),object) In [268]: arr = np.array(alist) In [269]: for ij in np.ndindex(res.shape): ...: res[ij] = arr[ij] ...: In [270]: res Out[270]: array([[array([1, 2]), array([2, 3])], [array([4, 5]), array([5, 6])], [array([7, 8]), array([8, 9])]], dtype=object) But that's a 2d array of arrays, not of tuples. In [271]: for ij in np.ndindex(res.shape): ...: res[ij] = tuple(arr[ij].tolist()) ...: ...: In [272]: res Out[272]: array([[(1, 2), (2, 3)], [(4, 5), (5, 6)], [(7, 8), (8, 9)]], dtype=object) That's better (or is it?) Or I could index the nested list directly: In [274]: for i,j in np.ndindex(res.shape): ...: res[i,j] = alist[i][j] ...: In [275]: res Out[275]: array([[(1, 2), (2, 3)], [(4, 5), (5, 6)], [(7, 8), (8, 9)]], dtype=object) I'm using ndindex to generate the all the indices of a (3,2) array. The structured array mentioned in the comments works because for a compound dtype, tuples are distinct from lists. In [277]: np.array(alist, 'i,i') Out[277]: array([[(1, 2), (2, 3)], [(4, 5), (5, 6)], [(7, 8), (8, 9)]], dtype=[('f0', '<i4'), ('f1', '<i4')]) Technically, though, that isn't an array of tuples. It just represents the elements (or records) of the array as tuples. In the object dtype array, the elements of the array are pointers to the tuples in the list (at least in the Out[275] case). In the structured array case the numbers are stored in the same as with a 3d array, as bytes in the array data buffer.\n",

      "There is nothing special about dangerouslySetInnerHTML. Rendering HTML from javascript could always be dangerous, regardless of using React or not, depending on the source of said HTML. For example, if you are rendering a post that you created yourself, and saved to a database, then there is no danger (unless your database has been compromised). But let's say you have comments on a post, and an user sends malicious code as a comment. All other users accessing that page, would fetch the malicious code from the database, and \"dangerously\" execute it on their browsers. So, what you need to do, is make sure the source of HTML is secure, by sanitizing any user input BEFORE saving to the database. There are libraries you can use to achieve that, example - http://htmlpurifier.org/ (http://htmlpurifier.org/) Regarding SEO, you can use server side rendering - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/server-side-rendering-react-node-express/ (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/server-side-rendering-react-node-express/) Make sure you have all the information you need available on the url, so you don't rely on \"state\" to render a page, like post id, etc. You can achieve that by using React Router - https://github.com/reactjs/react-router (https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)\n",

      "var context = this The reason why you would put this (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) into a different variable in this code is simply that function(){} (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) has a different this value based on where it gets called. In this case it's called from setTimeout as a callback, which means that this would be whatever it is inside of setTimeout instead of what it was when the debounce inner function was called You could get around this pretty easily in modern JavaScript using arrow functions (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), which have a lexical this - this is based on where the function was created instead of where it is called. This would be the equivalent code to the initial version with the correct this binding. function debounce(fn, delay) { var timer return function () { var args = arguments clearTimeout(timer) timer = setTimeout(() => { fn.apply(this, args) }, delay) } } fn.apply(context, args) function#apply (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) allows you to run a function with both a specific this value applied to it as well as passing in multiple arguments in an ergonomic way. Before we had rest syntax (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#rest_syntax_parameters), function#apply was the only approach to this, now you can actually just use fn(...args) in modern javascript (assuming you don't have to explicitly bind the this value of the function). Just keep in mind that this is an incredibly confusing concept for nearly everyone. The reason why you would bind context in general in the function as defined, is just so that debounce is more generic and more capable of being called in different circumstances. For example, in this case, we can use this to increment a counter based on the element that the function was called on. In practice, you wouldn't want the same debounced function put on both, you'd want to have one function and then debounce it twice, otherwise you could end up \"canceling\" a click on one by clicking on the other, but it's a good example of how this can make it more functional. function debounce(fn, delay) { var timer return function() { var args = arguments clearTimeout(timer) timer = setTimeout(() => { fn.apply(this, args) }, delay) } } const debounced = debounce(function() { this.dataset.numClicks = (Number.parseInt(this.dataset.numClicks || 0)) + 1; this.innerText = `Clicked ${this.dataset.numClicks} Times!` console.log(this.innerText) }, 500); document.querySelectorAll('button').forEach(el => el.addEventListener('click', debounced)); div { height: 100%; width: 100%; color: black; background: pink; } <button>Click me!</button> <button>Click me!</button>\n",

      "(Iron)Python is a dynamically typed language, there is no such notion of generic classes in python. You can derive from a generic .NET class, but you can't actually create a generic python class, there is no such thing.

      "To clarify, type is a metaclass (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-are-metaclasses-in-python), of which classes are instances. Just as an ordinary object is an instance of a class, any class in Python 3, is an instance of the type metaclass. This means, that type of an object is its corresponding class, but type of a class is its metaclass which is a type object as well. > type(type) <class 'type'> Interestingly, the type of type is type as well. More details here (https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses). As per official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=type#type) - class type(name, bases, dict) With one argument, return the type of an object. The return value is a type object and generally the same object as returned by object.__class__. So, type class when passed a single argument should return similar results as object.__class__ To test this and understand methods, classes, and metaclasses in python, let's define our own class. class myclass(): def __init__(self,s): self.m = s self.n = s*2 self.o = s*3 Notice that the __init__() method (which is invoked during instantiation of the class) takes in the parameter which allows the class to be instantiated as an object. Therefore, instantiating a class looks almost exactly the same as calling a method. obj = myclass('hello world ') #Returning the self dict obj.__dict__ {'m': 'hello world ', 'n': 'hello world hello world ', 'o': 'hello world hello world hello world '} Now let's check the class of the object and the class of the class to which the object belongs (metaclass). #Class of object obj > obj.__class__ __main__.myclass #Class of class of obj = Class of myclass > obj.__class__.__class__ type #Class of class of class of obj = Class of type > obj.__class__.__class__.__class__ type\n",

      "If your question is about the purpose of typing.Generic (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic) I would suggest you read through PEP 484 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0484). It has a section dedicated to user defined generic classes (https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#user-defined-generic-types) with some examples specifically for this, but the entire document is worthwhile reading IMHO. If you are unsure about the entire concept of generic types, the Wikipedia articles on parametric polymorphism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) and generic programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) might even be worth skimming. In very simple terms, you can use the Generic base class to define your own classes in a generic way, i.e. parameterized with regards to one or more type arguments. These type parameters are constructed via typing.TypeVar (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar). It is worth noting that in most cases these things are only relevant for the purposes of type safety, which is not really enforced by Python itself. Instead, static type checkers (most IDEs have them built-in) deal with those things. As to your example, it is entirely possible to define your class in a generic way and thus improve your own coding experience because you'll likely get useful auto-suggestions and warnings by your IDE. This only really becomes useful, if you use the type variables somewhere else throughout your class. Example: from typing import Generic, TypeVar class Base: pass ModelType = TypeVar(\"ModelType\", bound=Base) class CRUDBase(Generic[ModelType]): def __init__(self, model: type[ModelType]): self.model = model def get_model_instance(self) -> ModelType: return self.model() class Sub(Base): def foo(self) -> None: print(\"hi mom\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": crud_a = CRUDBase(Sub) crud_b = CRUDBase(Base) a = crud_a.get_model_instance() b = crud_b.get_model_instance() a.foo() b.foo() # error A good type checker like mypy will know, that a is of the Sub type and thus has the foo method, whereas b is of the Base type and therefore does not. And it will know so just from the way we annotated CRUDBase. PyCharm for example struggles with this (don't know why). Fortunately, we can help it out with explicit type annotations because we defined CRUDBase as a generic type: ... crud_a: CRUDBase[Sub] = CRUDBase(Sub) crud_b: CRUDBase[Base] = CRUDBase(Base) a = crud_a.get_model_instance() b = crud_b.get_model_instance() a.foo() b.foo() # PyCharm marks `foo` and complains Notice that so far there is nothing particularly \"abstract\" about our CRUDBase. It is fully self-contained and functioning like this (albeit not very useful yet). If you want a class to be an abstract base and not be directly instantiated, the abc (https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) module provides you with the tools you need. You can define an abstract base class and abstract methods (https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod) on it that all subclasses must implement. But I think it is clear now that this is a different concept. The idea is that an abstract class is not intended to be instantiated, only its subclasses are. I hope this helps point you in a few useful directions.\n",

      "You correctly identified this as a tree-like data structure, and it's very wise of you to transform it because the original representation is clearly and utterly broken. Now that you know that you have a tree, you need to ask yourself what its nodes are. In your case, a node is either: a leaf, which has a name and a value an inner node, which has a name and children The problem is that there are two different representation of the second type: A pair (\"<name>\", { \"<child1>\" : ..., \"<child2>\" }) A pair (\"<name>\", [{\"<child1>\" : ... }, { \"<child2>\": ... }]) Your example doesn't show it, but maybe the following would also be possible: (\"<name>\", [{\"<child1>\" : ... }, { \"<child2>\": ..., \"<child3>\": ... }]) Recursion is indeed a good way to solve this. The edge case is clear, it's the leaf nodes. You just need to check the two other cases first: def transform_node(name, val): if isinstance(val, list): val = (\"children\", [transform_node(k,v) for x in val for k, v in x.items()]) elif isinstance(val, dict): val = (\"children\", [transform_node(*kv) for kv in val.items()]) else: val = (\"value\", val) return dict([(\"name\", name), val]) Now you get: >>> transform_node(\"a\", 3) {'name': 'a', 'value': 3} >>> transform_node(\"a\", { \"c1\" : 3, \"c2\" : 4 }) {'name': 'a', 'children': [{'name': 'c2', 'value': 4}, {'name': 'c1', 'value': 3}]} >>> transform_node(\"a\", [{ \"c1\" : 3 }, { \"c2\" : 4, \"c3\": 5 }]) {'name': 'a', 'children': [{'name': 'c1', 'value': 3}, {'name': 'c3', 'value': 5}, {'name': 'c2', 'value': 4}]} Perfect! Now you can just do: >>> tree = { \"a\": { \"b\": 1 }} >>> transform_node(\"root\", tree) {'name': 'root', 'children': [{'name': 'a', 'children': [{'name': 'b', 'value': 1}]}]} Of course if you want \"a\" to be the root, you can then just extract the first child of the root. That said, it's probably better to represent this as a real data type using classes, instead of a dictionary, which is completly untyped.\n",

For each id in the roots, we can simply fetch from the mapping and that is a dictionary of the structure {'childid':child} where childid is the id (here a string) and child is again a dictionary of that form.

      "To generate a table of user entries using jQuery, you can follow these steps:\n",

      "1. Ensure your data is available as a JavaScript array or object. For example:\n",

      "2. Select the target table element where you want to insert the rows. In this case, let's assume the table has an ID `myTable`:\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "$('#myTable').find('tbody');\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use the `.each()` method to loop through each user object in your data array and create a new row (`<tr>`) for each one. Append cells (`<td>`) containing the user's properties to the row. Finally, append the row to the target table's body (`tbody`).\n",

      "To modify the output format of objects in Spring-Data/Hibernate/REST, you can utilize several approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Field Level Annotation**: Apply the `@JsonFormat` annotation directly to the specific field within your entity classes. For instance, to format a `LocalTime` field:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat;\n",
      "   import java.time.LocalTime;\n",
      "\n",
      "   @Entity\n",
      "   public class Time {\n",
      "       @Id\n",
      "       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)\n",
      "       private Long id;\n",
      "\n",
      "       @JsonFormat(pattern = \"HH:mm:ss\")\n",
      "       private LocalTime localTime;\n",
      "\n",
      "       // getters & setters\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This will ensure that the `localTime` field is serialized in the specified format (`HH:mm:ss`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Global Configuration**: Modify the global behavior of date formatting by updating the application properties. In your `application.properties`, include:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```properties\n",
      "   spring.jackson.serialization.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS=true\n",
      "   spring.jackson.date-format=yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   With these settings, all dates in your JSON responses will follow the specified format.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Custom Deserializer**: Implement a custom deserializer by extending `JsonDeserializer` or `JsonSerializer`. This approach allows you to define a custom logic for serializing or deserializing specific types. For example, to customize the output format for a `Date` type:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator;\n",
      "   import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonDeserializer;\n",
      "   import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n",
      "   import java.io.IOException;\n",
      "   import java.util.Date;\n",
      "\n",
      "   public class CustomDateDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer<Date> {\n",
      "       @Override\n",
      "       public Date deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\n",
      "           String text = p.getText();\n",

      "       }\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",

      "The easiest and most efficient solution to 'sharing variables' across functions would be to program using an Object Orientated approach (OOP). For a more in depth account of OOP check out: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) For a good guide on creating Tkinter applications using an OOP approach check: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDclKx-QpC9wntnURXVJqLyk (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDclKx-QpC9wntnURXVJqLyk) But in brief OOP uses classes to create objects. Each class has attributes (variables, features associated with that object) and methods (functions used to 'do things' using those attributes). The main feature that OOP will provide in your scenario is INHERITANCE. Inheritance allows functions withing a class to share variables but it also allows classes to inherit attributes from other classes. Looking at your code i assume you are trying to create a login feature. Using your example to get the value of E1 use the code below CODE: Make your Account function into a class class Account(tk.Tk): def __init__(self): tk.Tk.__init__(self) 'enter your code here e.g your labels and entry widgets' # when declaring E1 in your class you have to add self. self.E1 = Entry(self) self.E1.grid(blah blah) when getting entry value in another function pass argument self and call ##using self. def createNew(self): User = self.E1.get() Complete small interface example: from tkinter import * class Create: def __init__(self, master): frame = Frame(master) frame.pack() userInput = Label(frame, text=\"Enter text to pass to another funtion:\") userInput.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky=\"w\") self.userEntry=Entry(frame) self.userEntry.grid(row=1, column=1, sticky=\"w\") submit = Button(frame, text=\"submit\", command=self.getVariable) submit.grid(row=3,columnspan=2) def getVariable(self): text = self.userEntry.get() print(text) root = Tk() app = Create(root) root.mainloop() to pass variables you have to declare the variable as self.variableName and then pass self as an argument in the function you want to call that variable to and then just reference it. I urge you to watch the Sentdex videos i linked at the top he explains this in detail and shows you how to implement it. Good Luck and Have Fun coding!\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally we would make a variable in the common master, which is then passed down to the widgets. However you pass the root as a separate attribute. You should change that so that your main class is a subclass of tkinter.Tk: Here's a small example: import tkinter class EofCanvas(tkinter.Canvas): def __init__(self, master, *args, **kwargs): tkinter.Canvas.__init__(self, master=master, *args, **kwargs) self.bind(\"<ButtonPress-1>\", self.on_click) def on_click(self, event): self.master.status.set(\"CLICKED: {0.x}, {0.y}\".format(event)) class UserInfoGame(tkinter.Frame): def __init__(self, master, coord, *args, **kwargs): tkinter.Frame.__init__(self, master=master, *args, **kwargs) label = tkinter.Label(self, width=50, textvariable=self.master.status) #<--- Here the textvariable label.pack() class GameGUI(tkinter.Tk): def __init__(self, map_size, *args, **kwargs): tkinter.Tk.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs) self.status = tkinter.StringVar() # we make the variable in a place where all widgets can reach it canvas_game = EofCanvas(self, width=200, height=200, bg='white') # We pass \"self\", which includes all the instance variables user_info_game = UserInfoGame(self, bd=1, relief='ridge', coord=canvas_game) canvas_game.grid(column=1, row=1) user_info_game.grid(column=1, row=2) if __name__ == '__main__': appstart = GameGUI(30) #the int spcifies the size of the board (int x int) appstart.mainloop() We would appreciate it if you make small examples like this in the future, instead of asking us to pick through your massive code. There are other ways too, but I think this is the cleanest.\n",
      "\n",
      "This really has nothing to do with tkinter, you use the same technique whether it's plain python or tkinter or anything else. To access an attribute of an object, you need to have a reference to the object. For example, if you want Window2 to have access to data in Window1, you can pass the instance of Window1 to Window2: def _login_btn_clicked(self): ... self.newWindow = Toplevel(self.master) self.app = Window2(self.newWindow, window1=self) ... class Window2: def __init__(self,master, window1): self.window1=window1 ... username = self.window1.entry_username.get() self.output = Label(main, text=username)\n",

      "Normally I will setup the Main class as the controller of all the Frames, and have the Main inherits from Tk directly.

      "Your problem is that you created an instance attribute, not a class attribute. var is created individually for each instance you make. Therefore, you cannot access it independently: until you instantiate a GUI, that variable does not exist. What you want is a class attribute. You create it at the class level: class GUI(tkinter.Tk): GUI_var = 'value' def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.mainloop() print (GUI.GUI_var) This creates one instance of GUI_var, initialized when you define the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is with Python's scopes I talked about them in another answer of mine (https://stackoverflow.com/a/42423526/7237719). As Kevin (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43351486/how-can-i-use-get-tkinter-in-a-nother-def-python#comment73766318_43351486) said, you can use global declarations: global foo This is discouraged, the best use of global is no global at all, so I won't explain how it works. The other way to make that work is by using classes. In classes, def can use definitions from other functions, just what you want. Normally you can't use them between functions, for example, this will raise an error: def foo1(): string = 'x' def foo2(): print(string) foo1() #You would expect this to define the string foo2() #So this can print it... but no. But this will work: class foo: def foo1(self): self.string = 'x' def foo2(self): print(self.string) MyClass = foo() MyClass.foo1() MyClass.foo2() Line per line explanation: First, this line: MyClass = foo() This is actually making what's called an instance of the class. This will allow that each variable, function, or other thing defined in a instance can be accessed, from: Outside the same instance, or even outside of the class or any class, by using MyClass.var, MyClass.var(), etc. From the instance, by using self.var, self.var(), etc. Think of these in this way: A is an instance of a class, which has a method foo() and a method bar(). Somewhere in the code foo() calls bar(). If you want to call the foo() function from A in anywhere in the code use: A.foo(). If you had another instance, B then to call B's foo() you use B.foo() and so on. When foo() from any instance calls bar() from the same instance the line of code is self.bar(). So, self represents any instance of a class. The other lines This is similar to defining a function, you are telling Python that the next indented lines belong to a class (instead of a function) Define a function with no parameters (self is obligatory in a class, there is a reason for this (http://neopythonic.blogspot.com.uy/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html)) string = 'x' for every instance of this class Same as 2. Show the corresponding (with the instance) string x in screen. And then instantiates the class, and calls foo1() and foo2() Now you can apply that knowledge to fixing your code. If something is unclear I'll edit my question.\n",

      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering is due to the nature of `const` variables in JavaScript. Unlike `var` or `let`, `const` creates a constant reference to the value. This means you can't reassign a new value to the `const` variable, but you can modify the properties of objects or elements within arrays.\n",

      "In your case, the Google Closure Compiler is issuing a `JSC_CONSTANT_REASSIGNED_VALUE_ERROR` because you're attempting to reassign a new value to a variable declared with `const`. To resolve this, you should use `let` instead of `const` when you need to assign a new value to a variable.\n",

      "2. **Accessing Field Values**: For each field that matches the criteria, you can access its value using `getattr(self, field.name)`. This retrieves the actual data stored in the field for the specific instance (`self`).\n",
      "3. **Printing Values**: In this example, we simply print the field name and its corresponding value. Depending on your needs, you might want to perform other operations (e.g., logging, updating other fields, etc.).\n",
      "4. **Calling Super Save**: Finally, ensure to call `super().save(*args, **kwargs)` to maintain the original saving behavior of the Django model.\n",

And if the string is very large and it's not possible to change at each and every place you can follow the below solution. a look like this inititally {\"key1\": \"The sample \"data\", to convert to dict\"}' First replace all the \" with \\\". a = a.replace('\"', '\\\\\"') Now a looks like this {\\\"key1\\\": \\\"The sample \\\"data\\\", to convert to dict\\\"}.

      "The way to do what you're directly asking how to do here is to use string formatting. For example, using printf-style formatting (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting),1 instead of this: payload = \" … \\\"name\\\": \\\"name\\\" … \" … do this: template = \" … \\\"name\\\": \\\"%s\\\" … \" payload = template % (descr(),) While we're at it, if you put the payload in single quotes, you wouldn't need to escape every \". Even better, if you put it in triple quotes, you wouldn't need to escape all the newlines. See the tutorial section on Strings (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings) for details: template = \"\"\"{ \\t\"generateZeroFingerprintsData\": true, \\t\"name\": \"%s\", # … }\"\"\" But you can make things a whole lot easier by not doing any of this. You're trying to build a JSON text representing a dictionary. The easy way to do that is to just create the dictionary and JSON-ify it (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): payloadobj = { \"generateZeroFingerprintsData\": True, \"name\": descr(), # … } payload = json.dumps(payloadobj) Or, even better, let requests do it for you. Instead of passing data= with a string, pass it json= with a dict, and it automatically JSON-ifies it, and also sets the Content-Type header for you (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests): payload = { \"generateZeroFingerprintsData\": True, \"name\": name, # … } # … response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, params=querystring) (Also, notice that, instead of calling the generic request function and passing POST, which you really only want to do for custom HTTP verbs that requests doesn't know about (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#custom-verbs), I used the simpler post function, as shown in the quickstart docs (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request).) 1. In general, the newer braces-based formatting is simpler. Especially in 3.6+, where you can literally call a function inside quotes, just by wrapping it in braces inside an f-string, like `spam = f'eggs = {eggs()}'. But when the string you're trying to create is full of literal braces, but isn't full of literal percent characters, often that's an exception than the \"in general\".\n",

      "As suggested by Luke Bakken here (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pika-python/rryGk-54FsQ/T1gfo8-qCgAJ), this does the trick: import pika def handle(channel, method, properties, body): message = body.decode() print(\"received:\", message) connection = pika.BlockingConnection() channel = connection.channel() with connection, channel: message = \"hello\" next(channel.consume(queue=\"amq.rabbitmq.reply-to\", auto_ack=True, inactivity_timeout=0.1)) channel.basic_publish( exchange=\"\", routing_key=\"test\", body=message.encode(), properties=pika.BasicProperties(reply_to=\"amq.rabbitmq.reply-to\")) print(\"sent:\", message) for (method, properties, body) in channel.consume( queue=\"amq.rabbitmq.reply-to\", auto_ack=True): handle(channel, method, properties, body)\n",

Due to this, connection and channel objects are retained in the same thread. Note that Pika is not thread-safe so we need to maintain these objects in the same thread. The actual processing happens in a new thread spawned off the main. Once process_message is done with its processing, it puts the delivery_tag in the queue. check_acknowledge loops indefinitely till it finds the delivery_tag put in the queue by process_message. Once it does find, it acks the message and returns. I have tested this implementation by running this consumer by sleeping for 5 min, 10 mins, 30 mins and an hour.

You can set a maximum priority value of 255, but RabbitMQ recommends the maximum value to be 10.

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you analyze your logic you will see that what you indicate is expected, when you create the widget it is closing it since you called the close() method but in the next line you invoke the show() method that will make the window visible. To understand it better I can tell you that your code is equivalent to: from PyQt5 import QtWidgets import sys app = QtWidgets.QApplication (sys.argv) w = QtWidgets.QMainWindow () w.setWindowTitle (\"Should close\") w.close () w.show () app.exec_ () As you have noticed that a window closes does not imply that the application ends since they are 2 orthogonal concepts. If you want the close() method to also terminate the program then you must invoke the close() method when the eventloop starts: from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtWidgets import sys class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.setWindowTitle(\"Should close\") QtCore.QTimer.singleShot(0, self.close) app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv) w = MainWindow() w.show() app.exec_() Why is it necessary for the eventloop to terminate the application when closing the only open window? Well, because the evenloop (QApplication in this case) uses the flag quitOnLastWindowClosed, which by default is true, which makes the application terminate when the last window is closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your code is generating three windows and is using the buttons in the MainWindow to hide/show the other two windows. To generate new windows on button press, you need to call new instances of AnotherWindow and store them in MainWindow. For example: import sys from random import randint from PyQt5.QtWidgets import ( QApplication, QLabel, QMainWindow, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QWidget, ) class AnotherWindow(QWidget): \"\"\" This \"window\" is a QWidget. If it has no parent, it will appear as a free-floating window. \"\"\" def __init__(self): super().__init__() layout = QVBoxLayout() self.label = QLabel(\"Another Window % d\" % randint(0, 100)) layout.addWidget(self.label) self.setLayout(layout) class MainWindow(QMainWindow): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.windows = [] l = QVBoxLayout() button1 = QPushButton(\"Push for new window\") button1.clicked.connect(self.open_newWindow) l.addWidget(button1) w = QWidget() w.setLayout(l) self.setCentralWidget(w) def open_newWindow(self): window = AnotherWindow() self.windows.append(window) window.show() app = QApplication(sys.argv) w = MainWindow() w.show() app.exec_()\n",
      "\n",
      "The child window will be garbage-collected when the handleNewWindow method returns, and so it will never get the chance to be shown. You need to keep a reference to the child window, but the way you go about it depends on what you are trying to achieve. Do you literally want a new window to be opened every time the button is clicked? If so, then do this: def handleNewWindow(self): ex = Main(self) ex.show() class Main(QtGui.QWidget): ... def __init__(self, parent): QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent) self.setAttribute(QtCore.Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose) self.ui = Ui_Form() self.ui.setupUi(self) On the other hand, if you want the same child window to be opened every time, then do this: class FrmMainForm (QtGui.QWidget): def __init__(self): ... self._child_window = None def handleNewWindow(self): if self._child_window is None: self._child_window = Main(self) self._child_window.show() class Main(QtGui.QWidget): ... def __init__(self, parent): QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent) self.ui = Ui_Form() self.ui.setupUi(self) Note that in both cases, you can access the main window from the child window with self.parent().\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever a variable is local it gets \"garbage collected\" as soon as the function returns; this means that everything the variable might reference to will also be (possibly) deleted too. What is happening in your case is that while the windows is correctly created, it will be immediately deleted (due to the garbage collection) when the Call_Second_Window returns (just after Form.show()). To avoid that there is only one solution: make the reference to the object persistent. There are various approaches to achieve that, depending on the situation. Unfortunately your code is a bit unorthodox (especially from a PyQt perspective), so I'm \"refactoring\" it in order to make it more standardized, better object oriented and, also importantly, easily readable. import basic, windows_two from PyQt5 import QtWidgets class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.ui = basic.Ui_MainWindow() self.ui.setupUi(self) self.ui.printButton.clicked.connect(self.call_Second_Window) self.secondWindow = None def call_Second_Window(self): if not self.secondWindow: self.secondWindow = SecondWindow() self.secondWindow.show() class SecondWindow(QtWidgets.QWidget): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.ui = windows_two.Ui_Form() self.ui.setupUi(self) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import sys app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv) mainWindow = MainWindow() mainWindow.show() sys.exit(app.exec_()) Note: As you can see, I changed the name of call_Second_Window with a lower \"c\", and that's because capitalized names should only be used for classes and constants, while function names should always start with a lower case. This is again for readability, which is very important in programming and one of the core principles of python.

In the function, first convert the image to grayscale, and then detect its edges using the canny edge detector. With the edges detected, we can dilate and erode them once to give the edges more body: def process(img): img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) img_canny = cv2.Canny(img_gray, 10, 20) kernel = np.ones((13, 13)) img_dilate = cv2.dilate(img_canny, kernel, iterations=1) return cv2.erode(img_dilate, kernel, iterations=1) Define a function to generate a mask for the image. After finding the contours of the image, define a grayscale blank image with the shape of the image, and draw every contour (of area greater than 400 to filter out noise) filled in onto the blank image. I also approximated the contours to smoothen things out a bit: def get_mask(img): contours, _ = cv2.findContours(process(img), cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE) blank = np.zeros(img.shape[:2]).astype('uint8') for cnt in contours: if cv2.contourArea(cnt) > 500: peri = cv2.arcLength(cnt, True) approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(cnt, peri * 0.004, True) cv2.drawContours(blank, [approx], -1, 255, -1) return blank Finally, read in the image, and mask the image using the cv2.bitwise_and method, along with the get_mask function we defined, which uses the process function we defined. Show the masked image in the end: img = cv2.imread(\"crystal.jpg\") img_masked = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask=get_mask(img)) cv2.imshow(\"Masked\", img_masked) cv2.waitKey(0) Transparent Background Instead of the cv2.bitwise_and method, you can use the cv2.merge method: img = cv2.imread(\"crystal.jpg\") img_masked = cv2.merge(cv2.split(img) + [get_mask(img)]) cv2.imwrite(\"masked_crystal.png\", img_masked) Resulting image (screenshot): (https://i.stack.imgur.com/KgHKr.png) Explanation: Keeping in mind we already imported the cv2 module and the numpy module as np. We also defined a process function and a get_mask function, we can read in the image: img = cv2.imread(\"crystal.jpg\") The cv2.split method takes in an image array and returns a list of every individual channel present in the image. In our case, we only have 3 channels, and in order to make the image transparent, we need a forth channel: the alpha channel. The cv2.merge method does the opposite of cv2.split; it takes in a list of individual channels and returns an image array with the channels. So next we get the bgr channels of the image in a list, and concatenate the mask of the image as the alpha channel: img_masked = cv2.merge(cv2.split(img) + [get_mask(img)]) Lastly we can write the four channel image into a file: cv2.imwrite(\"masked_crystal.png\", img_masked) Here are some more example of the cv2.merge method: Python cv2.merge() Examples (https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/85133/cv2.merge)\n",

      "Velocity does not require or recommend the use of spaces around `#if`, `#else`, and `#end` directives. In fact, Velocity's design philosophy is to ignore leading and trailing whitespace, which means that any spaces you include will be ignored when rendering the template. This behavior is documented in the official Velocity User Guide (http://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html#vtl-formatting-issues).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there might be specific cases where you want to preserve whitespace for formatting purposes or due to limitations in the target environment (e.g., if the output is being processed by a tool that doesn't handle extra whitespace well). In such situations, you can consider using the following workarounds:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using comments**: If you need to include a comment before or after the `#else` directive without affecting the rendered output, you can use Velocity comments (`##`) to enclose the text. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   #if($foo == $bar)\n",
      "     it's true!\n",

      "   #end\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Manual line breaks**: If you need to insert a manual line break between the `#if` and `#else` directives, you can do so by placing a `#set()` directive with an empty string value before the `#else`. This way, you'll have control over where the line break occurs in the rendered output. For example:\n",

      "   ```\n",

      "   #end\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while Velocity does not require spaces around `#if`, `#else`, and `#end` directives, you may choose to include them for readability or specific formatting needs. Use comments or `#set()` directives with empty strings to maintain control over whitespace when necessary.\n",

      "You can create objects in a factory var Person = (function (params) { angular.extend(this, params); return { name: params.name, }; }); Person.create = function create(params) { return new Person(params); }; myApp.factory('Person', function ($timeout) { return Person; }); Then in your controller you can inject the factory and create Person objects. myApp.controller('HomeCtrl', function($scope, Person) { $scope.person = Person.create({ name: 'Andy' }); });\n",

      "The cool thing about angular.js is that it allows you to bind POJO on the scope. You can create it as you already know and just put it on the scope. I tend to register constructor functions as services, inject them into a controller and then instantiate an object per use. For example here is the service: app.factory('User', function() { function User(name, age, address) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.address = address; } User.prototype.sayName = function() { return this.name; }; return User; }); And a controller: app.controller('UserCtrl', ['$scope', 'User', function($scope, User) { $scope.user = new User('ilan', 30, 'Nahariya'); }]); And a template: <div ng-controller=\"UserCtrl\"> <h1>{{ user.sayName() }}</h1> </div>\n",
      "\n",
      "You are asking a lot of things things all in this question. Let's start at the end and work backwards since you asked the high level questions at the bottom there. What is the difference between create a function with myApp.factory vs create a function using $scope.function_name = function() In AngularJS, there is a concept of services that are injectable blocks of code for encapsulating certain functionality. To make things a bit more confusing, there are specific types of services with their own syntax. You could use .factory(), .provider(), or .service(), but they all pretty much provide the same purpose of being a place to put business logic that you might otherwise put in the controller (and in Angular 2 they are all consolidated in just \"services\"). 4) When searching the solution, I saw people create http request inside myApp.factory like How to wait till the response comes from the $http request, in angularjs? The responsibility of your main component (or controller) should be holding the data so that the view can display it. Calling out to an http request is not something that should be in your controller because then it becomes large and bloated. As a general rule of thumb: Keep your controllers as thin as possible, making use of \"helper\" services that provide one main service. 3) What is the difference between $scope.myCallbackFunction = function (response_param) { $scope.field_result_var = response_param.data; } and function myCallbackFunction(response_param) { $scope.field_result_var = response_param.data; } in angularjs? The concept you are asking about here is anonymous functions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function) which are not at all unique to AngularJS or even JavaScript for that matter. An anonymous function does not have a name. These are very common in JavaScript development, especially for callbacks of asynchronous operations. To the computer interpreting the code there is no difference, but the anonymous function uses less characters, less lines, and you don't need to jump around to find your callback function. As a general rule of thumb: If you never actually call the function by name, consider making it anonymous. 2) If I defined the callback function like, how to call it for my case? $scope.myCallbackFunction = function (response_param) { $scope.field_result_var = response_param.data; } You have defined the function as the value for a variable named $scope.myCallbackFunction. So you can then you can just do this: $scope.check_field_http = function() { $http({ method: 'GET', url: 'aaa.php', params : {field:$scope.field_data} }).then( $scope.myCallbackFunction, $scope.myCallbackFunction ); }; Now, to answer you original question, \"What is the mistake here?\". It seems that the console.log statement occurs inside of the $scope.check_field function. Async requests are non blocking in JavaScript so $scope.check_field_http will run, sending off its request. Then the interpreter will continue to step through the code, executing the log statement immediately after the request is sent but without waiting for a response to come back. If you want the console.log statement to occur after the request comes back then you should move it into the body of the function named myCallbackFunction.\n",

      "I thought I'd elaborate a bit in a real answer. I believe the differences between a service and a factory are so subtle it doesn't really matter. However, you stated that you know what a factory is and what a service is in design patterns. I thought I would elaborate on that a bit because I think that factory and service--as applied to AngularJS--are a bit misleading. First, the Factory design pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) is, basically, an object that creates other objects. However, when you create a factory in AngularJS; you do not use that factory to create other objects. The object returned from an Angular Factory is a Singleton and only one object will ever be returned when you access that factory. So, an Angular factory does not have the same meaning as \"Factory\" that I have used in the passed. In fact, when you create an Angular factory, you are responsible for creating the object, within the factory function. Once the object is created, the same object is always returned. So an Angular Factory does not even create a new object even once. It is nothing like a factory as I understood them from other languages. A Service design pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_layers_pattern) is really just a fancy way to organize different functionality so that it is separate from them. Back when I Was in school we just called this 'encapsulation' and I don't think of it as a design pattern. Both the AngularJS Service and the AngularJS Factory can you help you do this. The Angular Service is also a singleton, but the first time that service is referenced, it will call 'new' on the object in question. That means that the service creates a new object--so the AngularJS Service is more like a Factory than the AngularJS Factory. An Angular service is still a singleton, so once the object is created, the same object will always be returned. For all practical purposes, I use a service. They seem to be easier to set up. But the differences appear to be very subtle. Okay, let's add some elaboration on how factories and services work. Say, you have en object created like this: MyObject - function MyObject(){ foo : \"bar\"; } This object exists outside of AngularJS and could be used in any JavaScript. If you want to use it with a factory; you would do something like this: MyApp.factory('MyObjectFactory', function(){ return new MyObject(); }); Notice I had to manually call the new MyObject() fucntion to create a new object in the factory function. I could have also returned an existing object, like this: MyApp.factory('MyObjectFactory', function(){ return MyObject; }); Now, you want to pass it into a controller like this: function MyController($scope, MyObjectFactory) {} Angular finds the argument into the controller and looks for MyObjectFactory. It if it not yet instantiated, then the factory function is called, and the results are returned. The results are cached, so every time Angular needs to reference MyObjectFactory it will return the same object that was created the first time. The returned object in a Singleton and this is how you can share the same object between different controllers. The key point here is that the factory function is executed once; on first access of the factory. It is not used to manage the creation of multiple objects of the same type. A service out of the same object may be created like this: MyApp.service('MyObjectService', MyObject); And passed into the same controller, like this: function MyController($scope, MyObjectFactory, MyObjectService) {} When Angular needs to reference the MyObjectService for the first time, it will execute \"new MyObject()\" and return that object. The object is cached and every time MyObjectService is needed, the same object is returned. After this creation process, it is identical in usage to an AngularJS Factory. It is a singleton object, and you can use it to share data, or functionality between controllers. So, in the short, when using a Service a new instance of your object is automatically created. When using a Factory, whatever object is returned from your factory function is returned. Under the hood, both Service and Factory use a provider. With a service the factory function is provided for you. With a factory, you can make the function anything you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service A service is a constructor function which creates the object using the new keyword. You can add properties and functions to a service object by using the this keyword. Unlike a factory, it doesn't return anything (it returns an object which contains method). Service does place with this which is context of that service, and then return that context. Simply word you can not return object from the service, you could do that using factory because factory does return an object. Factory var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []); myApp.controller('mainCtrl', function($scope, TestService){ $scope.service = \"Data From Service: \"+TestService; }); var myFun = function() { var name = \"FirstName\"; return \"From myFun\"+this.name; }; // A service returns an actual function myApp.factory('TestService', myFun); But in above case you can only return one value at a time, for adding function you need to modify the object which you are going to return from the factory. Modified Factory var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []); myApp.controller('mainCtrl', function($scope, TestService) { $scope.service = \"Data From Service: \" + TestService; }); var myFun = function() { var TestService = {}; TestService.name = \"FirstName\"; TestService.get = function() { TestService.name = \"Second Name\"; return \"From myFun\" + TestService.name; }; }; // A service returns an actual function myApp.factory('TestService', myFun); Working Plunkr (http://plnkr.co/edit/lDwKLLINWYp6Ylq6pYOy?p=preview) For more details read this answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/28262966/2435473) where explained how service and factory are implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the value method of a module to store a function instead of having a factory returning a function like this : var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []); myApp.value('User', function () { return { \"name\": \"finding name...\", \"id\": \"\", \"age\": \"\", \"gender\": \"\" }; }); function ctrl($scope, User) { var user = new User(); console.log(user); }\n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on how you want to use your service. Factory is usually being used to store some constructor from which you can later instantiate some objects. For example: app.factory('Client', function () { function Client (name) { this.name = name; } Client.prototype.sayHello = function () { console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name + '!'); } return Client; }) .controller('ClientController', function (Client) { var bob = new Client('Bob'); }) If your service is singleton, you can register it as service instead of factory and angular will create an instance for you. Or you can register it as factory but return some object with methods. It is useful when you don't want to deal with context (this) inside your service logic: app.factory('ClientStorage', function () { function set () { // to be implemented } function get () { // to be implemented } return { get: get, set: set }; })\n",

      "Here's a very long answer I've given before. It explains in pretty great detail the reason being using the 'new' keyword vs not using it. TL;DR 1) When you’re using a Factory you create an object, add properties to it, then return that same object. When you pass this factory into your controller, those properties on the object will now be available in that controller through your factory. app.controller(‘myFactoryCtrl’, function($scope, myFactory){ $scope.artist = myFactory.getArtist(); }); app.factory(‘myFactory’, function(){ var _artist = ‘Shakira’; var service = {}; service.getArtist = function(){ return _artist; } return service; }); 2) When you’re using Service, Angular instantiates it behind the scenes with the ‘new’ keyword. Because of that, you’ll add properties to ‘this’ and the service will return ‘this’. When you pass the service into your controller, those properties on ‘this’ will now be available on that controller through your service. app.controller(‘myServiceCtrl’, function($scope, myService){ $scope.artist = myService.getArtist(); }); app.service(‘myService’, function(){ var _artist = ‘Nelly’; this.getArtist = function(){ return _artist; } }); Non TL/DR 1) Factory Factories are the most popular way to create and configure a service. There’s really not much more than what the TL;DR said. You just create an object, add properties to it, then return that same object. Then when you pass the factory into your controller, those properties on the object will now be available in that controller through your factory. A more extensive example is below. app.factory(‘myFactory’, function(){ var service = {}; return service; }); Now whatever properties we attach to ‘service’ will be available to us when we pass ‘myFactory’ into our controller. Now let’s add some ‘private’ variables to our callback function. These won’t be directly accessible from the controller, but we will eventually set up some getter/setter methods on ‘service’ to be able to alter these ‘private’ variables when needed. app.factory(‘myFactory’, function($http, $q){ var service = {}; var baseUrl = ‘https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=’; var _artist = ‘’; var _finalUrl = ‘’; var makeUrl = function(){ _artist = _artist.split(‘ ‘).join(‘+’); _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + ‘&callback=JSON_CALLBACK’; return _finalUrl } return service; }); Here you’ll notice we’re not attaching those variables/function to ‘service’. We’re simply creating them in order to either use or modify them later. baseUrl is the base URL that the iTunes API requires _artist is the artist we wish to lookup _finalUrl is the final and fully built URL to which we’ll make the call to iTunes makeUrl is a function that will create and return our iTunes friendly URL. Now that our helper/private variables and function are in place, let’s add some properties to the ‘service’ object. Whatever we put on ‘service’ we’ll be able to directly use in whichever controller we pass ‘myFactory’ into. We are going to create setArtist and getArtist methods that simply return or set the artist. We are also going to create a method that will call the iTunes API with our created URL. This method is going to return a promise that will fulfill once the data has come back from the iTunes API. If you haven’t had much experience using promises in Angular, I highly recommend doing a deep dive on them. Below setArtist accepts an artist and allows you to set the artist. getArtist returns the artist callItunes first calls makeUrl() in order to build the URL we’ll use with our $http request. Then it sets up a promise object, makes an $http request with our final url, then because $http returns a promise, we are able to call .success or .error after our request. We then resolve our promise with the iTunes data, or we reject it with a message saying ‘There was an error’. app.factory('myFactory', function($http, $q){ var service = {}; var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='; var _artist = ''; var _finalUrl = ''; var makeUrl = function(){ _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+'); _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&callback=JSON_CALLBACK' return _finalUrl; } service.setArtist = function(artist){ _artist = artist; } service.getArtist = function(){ return _artist; } service.callItunes = function(){ makeUrl(); var deferred = $q.defer(); $http({ method: 'JSONP', url: _finalUrl }).success(function(data){ deferred.resolve(data); }).error(function(){ deferred.reject('There was an error') }) return deferred.promise; } return service; }); Now our factory is complete. We are now able to inject ‘myFactory’ into any controller and we’ll then be able to call our methods that we attached to our service object (setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes). app.controller('myFactoryCtrl', function($scope, myFactory){ $scope.data = {}; $scope.updateArtist = function(){ myFactory.setArtist($scope.data.artist); }; $scope.submitArtist = function(){ myFactory.callItunes() .then(function(data){ $scope.data.artistData = data; }, function(data){ alert(data); }) } }); In the controller above we’re injecting in the ‘myFactory’ service. We then set properties on our $scope object that are coming from data from ‘myFactory’. The only tricky code above is if you’ve never dealt with promises before. Because callItunes is returning a promise, we are able to use the .then() method and only set $scope.data.artistData once our promise is fulfilled with the iTunes data. You’ll notice our controller is very ‘thin’. All of our logic and persistent data is located in our service, not in our controller. 2) Service Perhaps the biggest thing to know when dealing with creating a Service is that that it’s instantiated with the ‘new’ keyword. For you JavaScript gurus this should give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of you with a limited background in JavaScript or for those who aren’t too familiar with what the ‘new’ keyword actually does, let’s review some JavaScript fundamentals that will eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service. To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the ‘new’ keyword, let’s create a function and invoke it with the ‘new’ keyword, then let’s show what the interpreter does when it sees the ‘new’ keyword. The end results will both be the same. First let’s create our Constructor. var Person = function(name, age){ this.name = name; this.age = age; } This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the Person function using the ‘new’ keyword, ‘this’ will be bound to the newly created object. Now let’s add a method onto our Person’s prototype so it will be available on every instance of our Person ‘class’. Person.prototype.sayName = function(){ alert(‘My name is ‘ + this.name); } Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of Person will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance’s name. Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its prototype, let’s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName function. var tyler = new Person(‘Tyler’, 23); tyler.sayName(); //alerts ‘My name is Tyler’ So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to it’s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its prototype looks like this. var Person = function(name, age){ this.name = name; this.age = age; } Person.prototype.sayName = function(){ alert(‘My name is ‘ + this.name); } var tyler = new Person(‘Tyler’, 23); tyler.sayName(); //alerts ‘My name is Tyler’ Now let’s look at what actually is happening when you use the ‘new’ keyword in JavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using ‘new’ in our example, we’re able to call a method (sayName) on ‘tyler’ just as if it were an object - that’s because it is. So first, we know that our Person constructor is returning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know that because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly on the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be delegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we call tyler.sayName() the interpreter says “OK, I’m going to look on the ‘tyler’ object we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a minute, I don’t see it here - all I see is name and age, let me check the prototype. Yup, looks like it’s on the prototype, let me call it.”. Below is code for how you can think about what the ‘new’ keyword is actually doing in JavaScript. It’s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I’ve put the ‘interpreter view’ or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of notes. var Person = function(name, age){ //The line below this creates an obj object that will delegate to the person’s prototype on failed lookups. //var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype); //The line directly below this sets ‘this’ to the newly created object //this = obj; this.name = name; this.age = age; //return this; } Now having this knowledge of what the ‘new’ keyword really does in JavaScript, creating a Service in Angular should be easier to understand. The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services are instantiated with the ‘new’ keyword. Combining that knowledge with our examples above, you should now recognize that you’ll be attaching your properties and methods directly to ‘this’ which will then be returned from the Service itself. Let’s take a look at this in action. Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don’t need to create an object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we used the ‘new’ keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it delegate to it’s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the work. First things first, let’s create our ‘private’ and helper function. This should look very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won’t explain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if you’re confused, re-read the factory example. app.service('myService', function($http, $q){ var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='; var _artist = ''; var _finalUrl = ''; var makeUrl = function(){ _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+'); _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&callback=JSON_CALLBACK' return _finalUrl; } }); Now, we’ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to ‘this’. app.service('myService', function($http, $q){ var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='; var _artist = ''; var _finalUrl = ''; var makeUrl = function(){ _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+'); _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&callback=JSON_CALLBACK' return _finalUrl; } this.setArtist = function(artist){ _artist = artist; } this.getArtist = function(){ return _artist; } this.callItunes = function(){ makeUrl(); var deferred = $q.defer(); $http({ method: 'JSONP', url: _finalUrl }).success(function(data){ deferred.resolve(data); }).error(function(){ deferred.reject('There was an error') }) return deferred.promise; } }); Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myService into. Here’s the myService controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory controller). app.controller('myServiceCtrl', function($scope, myService){ $scope.data = {}; $scope.updateArtist = function(){ myService.setArtist($scope.data.artist); }; $scope.submitArtist = function(){ myService.callItunes() .then(function(data){ $scope.data.artistData = data; }, function(data){ alert(data); }) } }); Like I mentioned before, once you really understand what ‘new’ does, Services are almost identical to factories in Angular.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factory object is a shared instance, so anything you change in that factory object is going to change for everyone using it. Factory is the right thing to do, but it sounds like you want to encapsulate it in a different scope. This is fairly easy with Angular since all controllers get their own scope and directives have the option of having their own scopes as well. Assuming you are showing it in a controller you could do something like this: myapp.controller('OtherCtrl', [ 'MyFactory', '$scope', function(MyFactory,$scope) { // create a defensive copy of the factory object by creating a new object with the wrapped object as its prototype chain, anything can then access the data but changing the properties change only on $scope.theObject directly $scope.theObject = Object.create(MyFactory.getTheObject()); // alternatively, copy the relevant properties into our scope, it's protected but you won't be updated when the factory object changes unless you also specify a $watch statement var obj = MyFactory.getTheObject(); $scope.name = obj.name; }]); Updated: caveat One caveat when using the Object.create() defensive copy mechanism is that it will only JSON stringify the properties you modify. It will not work if you intend to modify a property then submit the entire object back to the server. It does work great for read-only properties, or for serializing only the modified properties however. And Angular will update the values of the non-modified properties without a $watch since it can still detect changes via the prototype chain. A fiddle demonstrating the difference between JSON.stringify and the prototype chain values is here http://jsfiddle.net/XXdqv/ (http://jsfiddle.net/XXdqv/)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think of Angular factory, service, filter, directive wrappers as ovens that create JavaScript objects and functions with Angular flavors. So, to borrow the same style from Vasiliy's answer: // Don't use this code in a real app. It's just to illustrate a point. angular.module('App', []) // The following oven makes an Angular flavored JavaScript function that // formats a currency .service('currencyBadFilterFn', // We inject a built-in Angular filter, currencyFilter, into our oven function(currencyFilter) { // oven produces a function that can be used in other places in Angular code return function(number) { // produced function returns a currency-formatted number when used return currencyFilter(number) } } ) .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, currencyBadFilterFn) { $scope.amount = currencyBadFilterFn(10) // $10.00 } ) As you can see, the same pattern is used in creating services. Here, we are creating a service that returns a function that we can use in other places in our code. The first function, the oven function, along with the .service or .factory or .filter wrapper, tells Angular how to build your function. The return value of that first function is what you will use in your code.\n",

      "ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In AngularJS, both `factory` and `service` are used to create singletons that can be injected into controllers and other services. However, there are some subtle differences between the two:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Factory**: A factory is a function that returns an object. This returned object can be a plain JavaScript object, an existing object, or an object created within the factory function. Factories are often used when you want to create a constructor function and then return an instance of that function. Factories can also be used to wrap existing JavaScript objects or functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   app.factory('MyFactory', function() {\n",
      "       var myObject = {\n",
      "           name: 'John',\n",
      "           sayName: function() {\n",
      "               console.log(this.name);\n",
      "           }\n",
      "       };\n",
      "\n",
      "       return myObject;\n",
      "   });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Service**: A service is a constructor function that is invoked with the `new` keyword when it's first requested. The returned object (i.e., `this`) is then injected into controllers and other services. Services are often used when you want to create a singleton object with methods and properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   app.service('MyService', function() {\n",
      "       var name = 'John';\n",
      "\n",
      "       this.sayName = function() {\n",
      "           console.log(name);\n",
      "       };\n",
      "   });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Value**: A value is a simple variable that can be injected into controllers and other services. Values are often used for small pieces of data that don't require complex logic or state management.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   app.value('MY_CONSTANT', 'Some constant value');\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Provider**: A provider is a special kind of factory that allows for configuration during the application's bootstrapping phase. Providers are less commonly used in AngularJS applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, choose a factory when you want to return an object (possibly created within the factory function), a service when you want to create a singleton object with methods and properties, and a value when you need to inject a simple piece of data.\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A solution is to remove all nan from the points and values input arrays prior to interpolating the data. numpy can be used efficiently for doing so: import numpy as np def func(x, y): return x*(1-x)*np.cos(4*np.pi*x) * np.sin(4*np.pi*y**2)**2 grid_x, grid_y = np.mgrid[0:1:10j, 0:1:10j] points = np.random.rand(100, 2) values = func(points[:,0], points[:,1]) values[0]=np.nan # now add a single nan value to the array #Find all the indexes where there is no nan neither in values nor in points. nonanindex=np.invert(np.isnan(points[:,0]))*np.invert(np.isnan(points[:,1]))*np.invert(np.isnan(values)) #Remove the nan using fancy indexing. griddata can now properly interpolate. The result will have nan only on the edges of the array from scipy.interpolate import griddata grid_z2 = riddata(np.stack((points[nonanindex,0],points[nonanindex,1]),axis=1), values[nonanindex], (grid_x, grid_y), method='cubic') While this solves the problem, I did not answer yet why this issue of the griddata function only appears for a cubic interpolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic why is that griddata passes both points and xi through a points = _ndim_coords_from_arrays(points) function whose documentation reads: Convert a tuple of coordinate arrays to a (..., ndim)-shaped array. and key action on tuples is: p = np.broadcast_arrays(*points) anything else, including a list, is just converted to an array: points = np.asanyarray(points) The actual interpolation expects arrays with the '3d' dimension last. So your list of 3 (200,200,200) arrays becomes an array of (3,200,200,200) shape. But your points array is (50,3). The number of dimensions in xi does not match x message results from 200 not matching 3. The griddata documentation is clear about points, less so for xi. But its example uses (x, Y) using arrays from mgrid. So this would work: X, Y, Z = np.meshgrid(*([np.linspace(-1,1,200)] * 3)) interp_vals = scipy.interpolate.griddata(points, values, (X,Y,Z), 'linear') Another way of generating the required array from your meshgrid list is to make it an array, and roll the 1st dimension grid_vals = np.rollaxis(np.array(grid_vals),0,4) Another way of generating a mesh is np.ix_, which returns an open mesh in the form of tuple. An open mesh like this does need the broadcasting. A single point would be interpolated with either: interpolate.griddata(points,values,[[[[0,0,0]]]],'linear') interpolate.griddata(points,values,([0],[0],[0]),'linear') See the reaction to John's 4123 pull request has more discussion about the whys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following should work: numcols, numrows = 300, 300 xi = np.linspace(data.Lon.min(), data.Lon.max(), numrows) yi = np.linspace(data.Lat.min(), data.Lat.max(), numcols) xi, yi = np.meshgrid(xi, yi) x, y, z = data.Lon.values, data.Lat.values, data.Z.values points = np.vstack((x,y)).T values = z wanted = (xi, yi) zi = griddata(points, values, wanted) So that last line is how griddata works (assuming you use scipy.interpolate.griddata?) The problem you have is that you seem to give griddata five arguments, while if i look at http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html#scipy.interpolate.griddata (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html#scipy.interpolate.griddata) It says the following: scipy.interpolate.griddata(points, values, xi, method='linear', fill_value=nan) So in your case, giving five arguments is where it goes wrong I guess (confirm if it works if you do it like this, since I don't have your data so I can't test if it gives the correct result). So in your case, your points where the values are known are the x, while the values which are known at that point are the y-values, and the points where you want to know them are at the z-values. No idea how the method='linear' copes with your argument, and the fill_value you give in is bad too, so you should just give the right inputs (which I think are correct the way I formulated them), and then it should work right. edit: read in your data as a txt, and wrote the following code. Can you run it to see if that is the result you wanted? import numpy as np from scipy.interpolate import griddata class d(): def __init__(self): A0 = open(\"test.txt\",\"rb\") # i just copypasted your data into a txt (without first row), and reading it in in this class, so that the names are the same as yours A1 = A0.readlines() A = np.zeros((len(A1),3)) for i, l in enumerate(A1): li = l.split() A[i,0] = float(li[0]) A[i,1] = float(li[1]) A[i,2] = float(li[2]) self.Lon = A[:,0] self.Lat = A[:,1] self.Z = A[:,2] data = d() numcols, numrows = 30, 30 xi = np.linspace(data.Lon.min(), data.Lon.max(), numrows) yi = np.linspace(data.Lat.min(), data.Lat.max(), numcols) xi, yi = np.meshgrid(xi, yi) x, y, z = data.Lon, data.Lat, data.Z points = np.vstack((x,y)).T values = z wanted = (xi, yi) zi = griddata(points, values, wanted) import pylab as plt fig = plt.figure(0, figsize=(8,4.5)) im = plt.contourf(xi, yi, zi) plt.colorbar() fig2 = plt.figure(1, figsize=(8,4.5)) im = plt.scatter(xi, yi, c= zi) plt.colorbar() plt.show()\n",

      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering with `scipy.interpolate.griddata` when using cubic interpolation arises due to the way the function handles the input coordinates (`points`) and the grid points (`xi`). Here's a detailed explanation and a corrected version of your code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Issue**:\n",
      "   - `griddata` expects `points` to be a `(N, D)` array, where `N` is the number of points and `D` is the number of dimensions. In your case, `points` is a `(50, 2)` array, representing 50 points in a 2D space.\n",
      "   - For cubic interpolation, `xi` must also be a `(M, D)` array, where `M` is the number of grid points. You've created a meshgrid for 3D space (`xi`, `yi`, `zi`), but `griddata` expects a 2D grid for 2D interpolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Usage**:\n",
      "   - To perform 2D interpolation, you should create a 2D grid for `xi` and `yi`.\n",
      "   - The `points` array should be reshaped to have the shape `(N, 2)`, where each row represents a point in 2D space.\n",

That's why you're getting the \"not a function\" error; you're trying to call a function on something that doesn't exist and JS doesn't know what to do with it.

      "\n",

      "There is no such thing as a regex matching infinitely; thus being stuck in an infinite loop. As an example, the regex .* will stop immediately when there are 0 characters and will run for n iterations on any string of n characters. A regex is a form of a finite state machine. A string, its input, is also always finite. There is no infinite in regular expressions. Here is a the same question asked in a CS context: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/47835/can-a-regular-expression-be-infinite (https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/47835/can-a-regular-expression-be-infinite)\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's true that a single application of a regular expression against a fixed string will not result in an infinite loop due to the finite nature of both the regex and the input string, there are certain patterns that can lead to exponential time complexity when applied iteratively or recursively. These patterns can cause the regex engine to take an excessively long time to complete, which might be perceived as \"indefinite\" in practical terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some indicators that a regex might exhibit such behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Backtracking**: Regex engines often employ backtracking to explore different possibilities during pattern matching. Certain regex patterns, especially those with nested quantifiers and alternations, can lead to extensive backtracking. For example, `(a|b)*` will backtrack extensively on the empty string, as it tries `bb`, `ba`, `aaa`, etc., before ultimately failing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recursive patterns**: Some regex engines support recursive patterns using constructs like Perl's `\\p{...}` or PCRE's recursion (`(?R)`). These can lead to deep recursion stacks, potentially causing performance issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Large lookaheads and lookbehinds**: Extensive use of positive or negative lookahead and lookbehind assertions can significantly slow down the regex engine, as they require additional checks without consuming input characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Capturing groups with many alternatives**: When multiple capturing groups have many alternatives, the regex engine must try each alternative in each group, leading to combinatorial explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, consider refactoring your regex patterns to reduce backtracking and improve readability and maintainability. If you're using a language that supports it, leveraging non-capturing groups (`(?:...)`) instead of capturing groups can help minimize backtracking. Additionally, you can use possessive quantifiers (`++`) where appropriate to prevent backtracking within specific parts of the regex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, if you're dealing with large datasets or performance-critical applications, consider using specialized tools or libraries designed for efficient pattern matching, such as finite automata-based engines or those optimized for specific use cases.\n",

      "\n",
      "You can use Collectors.partitioningBy (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#partitioningBy-java.util.function.Predicate-java.util.stream.Collector-) which does exactly what you want: Map<Boolean, Integer> result = inputList.stream().collect( Collectors.partitioningBy(x -> x%2 == 0, Collectors.summingInt(Integer::intValue))); The resulting map contains sum of even numbers in true key and sum of odd numbers in false key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing this in a single Stream pipeline would probably require the wanted operation to act like a full barrier: in order to group the values, we need to process them all to see which values are even and odd (and be able to sum them). As such, it is probably preferable to use a temporary data structure to hold the count of even and odd values, which in this case would be a Map<Integer, Integer> or even a Map<Boolean, Integer> (where, for example, the key would be true for even values and false for odd values, using Collectors.partitioningBy). Note that you don't need to use the StreamEx library here. You can do this directly the Stream API: public static void main(String[] args) { Map<Integer, Integer> map = Stream.of(0, 1, 2, 4) .collect(Collectors.groupingBy( i -> i % 2, Collectors.summingInt(i -> i) )); Stream<Integer> stream = map.values().stream(); }\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming your functional interface's sum method return an integer, you could use the reduce method from stream. So your functional interface would be: @FunctionalInterface public interface Test{ int sum(int a, int b); } And here is the example of reduce method: yourArraysList.stream().reduce(0, testImpl::sum); Where testImpl is an instance of the implementation of the functional interface Test. There's also a sum() method on stream, that deals with sum of stream's elements. Reference here (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/reduction.html)\n",

      "A possible solution would be to map each value in the array to itself if it's even and to its opposite if it's odd. That way, by summing the result, you will have added all even numbers and subtracted all odd ones.

For example, in my default timezone (America/Sao_Paulo), last year (2016), DST started at October 16th: at midnight, the clocks move 1 hour ahead (so, tecnically, midnight doesn't exist at this day, because time changes from 23:59:59 to 01:00:00). The problem is, when parsing MM/dd/yyyy format, there's no fields for hour, minute or second, and the parser sets 0 as a default value for all these fields (so the hour becomes midnight). But if I try to parse in a date where DST starts (like 10/16/2016) and don't use the UTC as above, the code throws an exception because midnight doesn't exist in that day (due to DST hour shift). Using UTC avoids this error, as DateTimeZone.UTC has no DST effects. With this, the code works independent of your system's default timezone. The output is: 06/14/2017 06/14/2017 PS: As you care only about the date part (day/month/year), you could also use the org.joda.time.LocalDate class. To use it, just change the last part of the code (you can use the same parser): // test with MM/dd/yyyy LocalDate dt1 = parser.parseLocalDate(\"06/14/2017\"); System.out.println(parser.print(dt1)); // 06/14/2017 // test with yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss LocalDate dt2 = parser.parseLocalDate(\"2017-06-14T10:30:40\"); System.out.println(parser.print(dt2)); // 06/14/2017 The output is the same: 06/14/2017 06/14/2017 Using a LocalDate is another way to avoid problems with Daylight Saving Time (as explained above). In this case, you don't need to set UTC, because LocalDate has no timezone information.\n",

      "All the other answers are missing the point that the string representation of the date-time needs to be localized. Joda-Time The Joda-Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) 2.3 library makes this work much easier. Joda-Time leverages a java.util.Locale (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html) to determine proper formatting of a date-time's string representation. The DateTimeFormat (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html) class offers an option for \"style\" pattern as a way of generating a DateTimeFormatter (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html). You specify a two character style pattern. The first character is the date style, and the second character is the time style. Specify a character of 'S' for short style, 'M' for medium, 'L' for long, and 'F' for full. A date or time may be omitted by specifying a style character '-'. If you do not specify a Locale or time zone, the JVM's default will be used. Locale To create a java.util.Locale (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html), you need: Language code (either, see combined list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)) ISO 639 alpha-2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) ISO 639 alpha-3 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2) Country Code (either) ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) UN M.49 numeric-3 area code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_M.49) Example Code // Simulate input. long millisecondsSinceEpoch = DateTime.now().getMillis(); // Proceed with a 'long' value in hand. DateTime dateTimeUtc = new DateTime( millisecondsSinceEpoch, DateTimeZone.UTC ); DateTimeZone timeZone = DateTimeZone.forID( \"Asia/Riyadh\" ); DateTime dateTimeRiyadh = dateTimeUtc.withZone( timeZone ); // 'ar' = Arabic, 'SA' = Saudi Arabia. java.util.Locale locale = new Locale( \"ar\", \"SA\" ); // ( language code, country code ); DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormat.forStyle( \"FF\" ).withLocale( locale ).withZone( timeZone ); String output = formatter.print( dateTimeUtc ); Dump to console… System.out.println( \"millisecondsSinceEpoch: \" + millisecondsSinceEpoch ); System.out.println( \"dateTimeUtc: \" + dateTimeUtc ); System.out.println( \"dateTimeRiyadh: \" + dateTimeRiyadh ); System.out.println( \"output: \" + output ); When run… millisecondsSinceEpoch: 1392583624765 dateTimeUtc: 2014-02-16T20:47:04.765Z dateTimeRiyadh: 2014-02-16T23:47:04.765+03:00 output: 16 فبراير, 2014 AST 11:47:04 م\n",

Please also note the different behaviour of method withZone(...). Joda-Time When parsing, this zone will be set on the parsed datetime. A null zone means of no-override. If both an override chronology and an override zone are set, the override zone will take precedence over the zone in the chronology. Java-8 (JSR-310) When parsing, there are two distinct cases to consider. If a zone has been parsed directly from the text, perhaps because DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendZoneId() was used, then this override Zone has no effect. If no zone has been parsed, then this override zone will be included in the result of the parse where it can be used to build instants and date-times. Side remark: The Joda-Time-method withOffsetParsed() is closer to Java-8-behaviour. Update: I have now done my own tests. See the sometimes surprising results. System.out.println(System.getProperty(\"java.version\")); // 1.8.0_31 // parsing s1 with offset = UTC String s1 = \"2015-01-01T12:29:22+00:00\"; OffsetDateTime odt1 = DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.parse(s1, OffsetDateTime::from); System.out.println(odt1); // 2015-01-01T12:29:22Z --- OK LocalDateTime ldt1 = DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.parse(s1, LocalDateTime::from); System.out.println(ldt1); // 2015-01-01T12:29:22 --- OK ZonedDateTime zdt1 = DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.withZone(ZoneId.of(\"America/New_York\")).parse(s1, ZonedDateTime::from); System.out.println(zdt1); // 2015-01-01T12:29:22-05:00[America/New_York] --- seems to be a bug compared with the spec above, the parsed offset was overridden!!! // now parsing s2 without offset String s2 = \"2015-01-01T12:29:22\"; OffsetDateTime odt2 = DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.parse(s2, OffsetDateTime::from); System.out.println(odt2); // 2015-01-01T12:29:22Z --- questionable, the offset Z is invented/guessed here LocalDateTime ldt2 = DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.parse(s2, LocalDateTime::from); System.out.println(ldt2); // 2015-01-01T12:29:22 --- OK DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.withZone(ZoneId.of(\"America/New_York\")).parse(s2, ZonedDateTime::from); // throws an exception --- seems to be a bug compared with the spec above, the zone set was not accepted Conclusion: I would be careful when migrating. The devil is in the details. Maybe a newer Java-version 8u40 has meanwhile corrected some of the problems shown (at least the behaviour of withZone() is probably corrected - see JDK-issue 8033662 (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8033662), but for 8u31 the backport fix appears to be missing?!). You should also note that your \"timezone\" labelled \"EST\" was replaced by \"America/New_York\" in my tests because \"EST\" is not a recognized timezone id (it is rather a localized timezone name abbreviation in US). Update - final solution After extra testing this code seems to work in Java 8u31 (assuming UTC as default in case of missing offset in input): static final DateTimeFormatter DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss[xxx]\"); OffsetDateTime odt = DATE_TIME_OPTIONAL_OFFSET.withZone(ZoneOffset.UTC).parse(input, OffsetDateTime::from); ZonedDateTime zdt = odt.toZonedDateTime(); // containing a fixed offset\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a cheap way to deep clone an object in JavaScript (https://stackoverflow.com/a/5344074/3689450). Consider the following: function a() { const obj = {name: \"fred\"}; b(obj); console.log(obj); } function b(obj) { obj.age = 42; } a(); The function a passes an object to b and when it gets modified. Sometimes that is what you want, other times, you want to preserve the original object from modifications, so you have to clone it. JavaScript doesn't have any facility to do that but JSON.stringify -> JSON.parse will create a new object for you so it be used for cloning: function a() { const obj = {name: \"fred\"}; b(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))); console.log(obj); } function b(obj) { obj.age = 42; } a(); This is a good illustration of what can get wrong, but in the real world, it's not always so simple. The above can also be done through a shallow clone of the object function a(){ const obj = {name: \"fred\"}; b(Object.assign({}, obj)); //shallow clone console.log(obj); } function b(obj) { obj.age = 42; } a(); However, that will fail in the following scenario: const obj = { name: \"fred\", child: { name: \"pebbles\" } }; const objClone = Object.assign({}, obj) objClone.age = 42; objClone.child.age = 2; console.log('the \"cloned\" object was modified', objClone); console.log(\"so was the original nested object\", obj); This is because the nested object child was not cloned, so we modified the top-level clone of the parent but then modified the original child. Here is when deep cloning is useful: const obj = { name: \"fred\", child: { name: \"pebbles\" } }; const objClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); objClone.age = 42; objClone.child.age = 2; console.log('the cloned object was modified', objClone); console.log(\"none of the original was\", obj); This doesn't solve all problems. JSON.stringify and then JSON.parse only works with very simple objects anywhere, it will not copy prototypes or functions. Some examples: const obj = { name: \"Alice\" }; const proto = { age: 42 }; Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto); console.log(\"assembled object\", obj); const clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); console.log(\"cloned object\", clone); const objWithFunction = { name: \"Bob\", getAge: function() { return 42; } }; console.log(\"object with function assigned to property\", objWithFunction); console.log(\"getAge from original\", objWithFunction.getAge()); const cloneWithFunction = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(objWithFunction)); console.log(\"cloned object with function assigned to property\", cloneWithFunction); console.log(\"getAge from clone\", cloneWithFunction.getAge()); function Person(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } const p = new Person(\"Carol\", 42); console.log(\"what is p:\", p); console.log(\"is p a Person?\", p instanceof Person); const clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(p)); console.log(\"what is clone:\", clone); console.log(\"is clone a Person?\", clone instanceof Person); console.log(\"the clone is actually a plain object:\", Object.getPrototypeOf(clone) == Object.prototype);\n",

      "First let's clarify the difference between shallow and deep clone: A shallow clone is a clone that has its primitive properties cloned but his REFERENCE properties still reference the original. Allow me to clarify: let original = { foo: \"brlja\", howBigIsUniverse: Infinity, mrMethodLookAtMe: () => \"they call me mr. Method\", moo: { moo: \"MOO\" } }; // shallow copy let shallow = Object.assign({}, original); console.log(original, shallow); // looks OK shallow.moo.moo = \"NOT MOO\"; console.log(original, shallow); // changing the copy changed the original Notice how changing the shallow copy's not primitive property's inner properties REFLECTED on the original object. So why would we use shallow copy? It is definitely FASTER. It can be done in pure JS via 1 liner. When would you use shallow copy? All of your object's properties are primitives You are making a partial copy where all your copied properties are primitives You don't care about the fate of the original (is there a reason to copy and not use that one instead?) Oke, let's get into making a propper (deep) copy. A deep copy should obviously have the original object coped into the clone by value, not references. And this should persist as we drill deeper into the object. So if we got X levels deep nested object inside of the original's property it should still be a copy not a reference to the same thing in memory. What most people suggest is to abuse the JSON API. They think that turning an object into a string then back into an object via it will make a deep copy. Well, yes and NO. Let's attempt to do just that. Extend our original example with: let falseDeep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original)); falseDeep.moo.moo = \"HEY I CAN MOO AGAIN\"; console.log(original, falseDeep); // moo.moo is decoupled Seems ok, right? WRONG! Take a look at what happened to the mrMethodLookAtMe and howBigIsUniverse properties that I sneaked in from the start :) One gives back null which is definitely not Infinity and the other one is GONE. Well, that is no bueno. In short: There are problems with \"smarter\" values like NaN or Infinity that get turned to null by JSON API. There are FURTHER problems if you use: methods, RegExps, Maps, Sets, Blobs, FileLists, ImageDatas, sparse Arrays, Typed Arrays as your original object's properties. Why? Well this produces some of the nastiest to track bugs out there.. I have nightmares tracking the disappearing methods or type being turned to another (which passed someone's bad input parameter check but then couldn't produce a valid result) before Typescript became a thing. Time to wrap this up! So what is the correct answer? You write your own implementation of a deep copy. I like you but please don't do this when we have a deadline to meet. Use a deep cloning function provided to you by the library or framework you already use in the project. Lodash's cloneDeep Many people still use jQuery. So in our example (please put import where it belongs, on top of the file): import jQ from \"jquery\"; let trueDeep = jQ.extend(true, original, {}); console.log(original, trueDeep); This works, it makes a nice deep copy and is a one-liner. But we had to import the entire jQuery. Which is fine if it is already being used in project, but I tend to avoid it since it is over-bloated and has terribly inconsistent naming. Similarly, AngularJS users can use angular.copy(). But what if my framework/library does not have a similar function? You can use my personal SUPERSTAR among JS libraries (I am not involved in the project, just a big fan) - Lodash (or _ for friends). So extend our example with (again, mind the position of import): import _ from \"lodash\"; // cool kids know _ is low-dash var fastAndDeepCopy = _.cloneDeep(objects); console.log(original, lodashDeep); It is a simple oneliner, it works, it is fast. This is pretty much it :) Now you know the difference between shallow and deep copy in JS. You realize JSON API abuse is just that, abuse and not a true solution. If you are using jQuery or AngularJS already you now know there is a solution already there for you. If not you can write your own or consider using lodash. The entire example can be found here: codesandbox - entire example (https://codesandbox.io/s/amazing-greider-2s5wn?file=/src/index.js)\n",

      "As you may read in Object.assign (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign#warning_for_deep_clone) page: For deep cloning, we need to use alternatives, because Object.assign() copies property values. If the source value is a reference to an object, it only copies the reference value. For more, read about Deep copy (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Deep_copy) and Shallow copy (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shallow_copy). In your example: const obj1 = { a: 0, b: { c: 0 } }; const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1); obj2 has a shallow copy of obj1, which means it has a copy of the values that are in the first level (a) and a reference to the object that's in b. If you change obj2.a, you would change the value in the copy. But when you do obj2.b you are using the reference of the object in obj1 that had {c: 0}. That's why when you change obj2.b you are referring to that same object (c) which was referred in obj1. They both point to the same memory address. If you want to do a deep copy you can use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(OBJ)) which basically will create a string from your object, then it passes it to JSON.stringif which will return a new object (with new references). You may also have a look at: What is the most efficient way to deep clone an object in JavaScript?

Converting back to an object from JSON will create new objects for all children and other descendants. function addName(people) { var obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(people)); obj.names.push('Jason'); // obj.names is now completely different than people.names } var p = { names: ['Miguel'] }; addName(p); // p.names will be ['Miguel']\n",

See Deep Copy below for further explanation.

Deep Copy The least elegant method is probably safest. It deep copies the properties over into a new object. The key difference with Object.assign() is that it copies the values of nested properties, whereas Object.assign() copies the reference to nested objects. So with Object.assign() any subsequent changes in your nested objects will affect all versions of your \"clones\". This won't happen if your clones only have property values of those nested objects at the time of cloning – these values are not affected by any changes to the nested objects. const deepCopy = function(src) { let target = {}; // using for/in on object also returns prototype properties for (let prop in src) { // .hasOwnProperty() filters out these prototype properties. if (src.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { target[prop] = src[prop]; //iteratively copies over values, not references } } return target; } let data_base = deepCopy(data); let data_postero = deepCopy(data);\n",

      "### QUESTION:\n",
      "Why is the click function in jQuery ineffective when applying two CSS classes?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This happens because the jQuery collection of elements that have the \"alert\" class is determined when the main script runs, and only those will get the appropriate click handler assigned to them. At that moment there is only one such element. If later the class is also given to another element, this will not dynamically attach the click handler to that element too. The solution is event delegation. Listen to click events that bubble up to an element that is higher up the DOM tree, like body, and check that the click event originated at an element that at that moment had the class \"alert\". In jQuery the syntax for such event delegation is demonstrated here: $(\"body\").on('click', '.alert', function() { alert(\"alert\"); }); $('.secondButton').click(function() { $('.thirdButton').addClass('alert'); }); <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <button class=\"alert\">Button A</button> <button class=\"secondButton\">Button B</button> <button class=\"thirdButton\">Button C</button>\n",
      "\n",
      "This usually happens because you are binding your events with direct bindings such as... $('.myClass').click(function () { //... }); This will only apply to .myClass elements that are present at the time this binding runs. If you want to apply to elements that will be added to the DOM later, use the more dynamic on binding. $(document).on('click', '.myClass', function () { //... }); You can also be more specific - rather than using document - but that was for the purposes of the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Event listeners are attached to DOM elements on page load. You either need to reattach this one or you can listen for click events on the document that target your button. $(document).on('click', '#element-empty', function() { $(this).addClass('myClass'); });\n",
      "\n",
      "When you bind events to a DOM element, they are bound to the element itself, not to its classname: the selector is used only to figure out which element to bind the event to. Removing the classname does not also remove the click event already bound to that DOM element: $('.foo').on(\"click\", function() { console.log(\"CLICKED\"); }); // Remove the class, but the bound event will remain: $('.foo').removeClass('foo'); <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <button class=\"foo\">Click me</button> Similarly, adding a classname to an element will not attach events to that element that were bound before the classname was added: // This won't match anything because when it's called, nothing has .bar: $('.bar').on(\"click\", function() { console.log(\"CLICKED\"); }); // Adding the 'bar' class later will have no effect, because the attempt at event binding already happened: $('.foo').addClass('bar'); <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <button class=\"foo\">Click me</button> If you want to have the event associated with the classname rather than with a specific DOM element, you can use delegated events instead. Here, the event is bound to a higher-level DOM element, which at the time of the event trigger will search within its contents for elements matching the selector: //This delegated event won't match anything at first: $('.container').on(\"click\", \".foo\", function() { console.log(\"CLICKED\"); }); // This will allow the delegated event to fire: $('#switch').on(\"click\", function() { $('.container button').addClass('foo'); }); <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <div class=\"container\"> <button>Click me</button> </div> <button id=\"switch\">Add class</button> To clarify the difference: normal event binding uses the selector when the event is being bound, and attaches the event to the specific matched DOM elements. Delegated event binding binds the event to a parent element, and uses the selector when the event is triggered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you're seeing is a bit of a race condition. With your button click event handler you're adding a class and an ID to your button. Then with your delegated event handler you're looking for any clicks on the document, even those that bubble up from descendant elements, and adding a class there as well. One way to handle this is to add a small (~ 1 msec) delay to short-circuit this race that would normally occur with your example code. $(document).ready(function() { $(\"#button\").click(function() { $(\"#button\").addClass(\"toMenu\") setTimeout(function() { $(\"#button\").attr(\"id\", \"menu\"); }, 1) }); }); $(document).on(\"click\", \"#menu\", function() { $(\"#menu\").addClass(\"menuTransition\"); }); .toMenu { font-weight: bold; } .menuTransition { color: red; } <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <button id=\"button\"> button </button> By adding the 1 millisecond delay, the ID is added after the click on the button has reached the document event handler, so that event handler only fires after the first click on the button.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $(\".add\") just selects elements that at that moment have the add class. It doesn't mean the click event will magically be assigned to other elements when their classes change. This can be achieved, though, by using the JQuery live (http://api.jquery.com/live/) method to bind the events.\n",
      "\n",
      "click events bubble from the element that was clicked up through to the document, passing through all elements en route. So what happens when you click your button is that while the class gets added (because the button has the class button), the click bubbles to the form (which doesn't) and then to body (which doesn't) and then to html (which doesn't). Your handler is called at each level, because you've attached it to all elements, and so the last one (html) wins. So the minimal change to your code is to stop propagation (tell the event to stop bubbling) when you handle the click: $(\"*\").click(function(e) { // Note --------------^ e.stopPropagation(); // <=== var ret = $(this).hasClass(\"button\"); if (ret) { $(\".button\").addClass(\"newclass\"); } else { $(\".button\").removeClass(\"newclass\"); } }); Example: $(function() { $(\"*\").click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); var ret = $(this).hasClass(\"button\"); if (ret) { $(\".button\").addClass(\"newclass\"); } else { $(\".button\").removeClass(\"newclass\"); } }); $(\"form\").on(\"submit\", function() { return false; }) }); .newclass { color: red; } <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js\"></script> <form method=\"get\" action=\"\"> <input type=\"text\" name=\"\"> <input type=\"submit\" name=\"\" class=\"button\"> </form> But, I would change your approach entirely. Instead of having a handler on every element in the DOM, I would just attach to document and then inspect e.target: $(document).click(function(e) { // ^^^^^^ --- note --------^ var ret = $(e.target).hasClass(\"button\"); // Note ------^^^^^^^^ if (ret) { $(\".button\").addClass(\"newclass\"); } else { $(\".button\").removeClass(\"newclass\"); } }); That waits for the click to bubble up to document.body, and then looks at where it bubbled from (e.target). Example: $(function() { $(document).click(function(e) { // Note ------------------------^ var ret = $(e.target).hasClass(\"button\"); if (ret) { $(\".button\").addClass(\"newclass\"); } else { $(\".button\").removeClass(\"newclass\"); } }); $(\"form\").on(\"submit\", function() { return false; }) }); .newclass { color: red; } <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js\"></script> <form method=\"get\" action=\"\"> <input type=\"text\" name=\"\"> <input type=\"submit\" name=\"\" class=\"button\"> </form> If you were using an element that could have child elements (like button instead of input), you'd have the situation where the click might originate in a child or descendant of the button. In that case, you might use closest to figure out whether the click passed through a .button element en route to document: var ret = $(e.target).closest(\".button\").length; if (ret) { // The element clicked or an ancestor of it has the class... (There we're relying on the fact that 0 is falsy but all other non-NaN numbers aren't.) Example: $(function() { $(document).click(function(e) { // Note ------------------------^ var ret = $(e.target).closest(\".button\").length; if (ret) { $(\".button\").addClass(\"newclass\"); } else { $(\".button\").removeClass(\"newclass\"); } }); $(\"form\").on(\"submit\", function() { return false; }) }); .newclass { color: red; } <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js\"></script> <form method=\"get\" action=\"\"> <input type=\"text\" name=\"\"> <button class=\"button\"> Direct <strong>Child</strong> </button> </form>\n",

      "Events are bound to the DOM nodes, not the class-names (though the class-names are, of course, used to initially select the relevant element(s)); so when the class-name changes the events are no longer bound, so you need to delegate the event-handler to the parent with on(): $('#container').on('click', '.main', function () { $(this).removeClass(\"main\").addClass(\"other\"); $(this).next() .removeClass(\"other\").addClass(\"main\"); }); JS Fiddle demo (http://jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/UHLft/3/).

      "Events are not triggered on classes, the are triggered on elements. If the classes \"class_one\" and \"class_two\" are set on the same element then events are called in the same order they where bound. However events bubble up, meaning the \"click\" event is first triggered on element clicked, then its parent and so forth. This means if you have the ability to change the DOM, you can force the events on the element with class \"class_one\" to be fired first. This can be done by removing the \"class_two\" class from the element and wrapping it around the \"class_one\" element. This behaviour is can be found described in the jQuery on (https://api.jquery.com/on/) documentation: When a selector is provided, the event handler is referred to as delegated. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector. jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector. $('body').on('click', '.class_one', function() { console.log(\"First\") }) $('body').on('click', '.class_two', function() { console.log(\"Second\") }) $('body').on('click', '.class_one', function() { console.log(\"Third\") }) $('body').on('click', '.class_two', function() { console.log(\"Fourth\") }) <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <div class=\"class_two\"> <div class=\"class_one\">Click me</div> </div> Like already said above: If the classes \"class_one\" and \"class_two\" are set on the same element then events are called in the same order they where bound. Which can also be also found in the on (https://api.jquery.com/on/) documentation: Event handlers bound to an element are called in the same order that they were bound. This property could be used to register two events that act as a \"register\" and fire all events added to this \"register\" (a simple array in the example). This solution doesn't require you to change the DOM, but instead requires you to change the event registration in JavaScript. const class_one_click_fns = [], class_two_click_fns = []; $('body').on('click', '.class_one', function(...args) { class_one_click_fns.forEach(fn => fn.call(this, ...args)) }) $('body').on('click', '.class_two', function(...args) { class_two_click_fns.forEach(fn => fn.call(this, ...args)) }) class_one_click_fns.push(function () { console.log(\"First\") }) class_two_click_fns.push(function () { console.log(\"Second\") }) class_one_click_fns.push(function () { console.log(\"Third\") }) class_two_click_fns.push(function () { console.log(\"Fourth\") }) <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <div class=\"class_one class_two\">Click me</div>\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is you're trying to attach the event handler before it even has the class second or third. Besides this approach is pretty verbose. I suggest simply providing an array of classes. Like so: var classNames = ['first', 'second', 'third']; Then add a different identifier to the button, for instance add a class class-changer. And attach the following event handler. $('.class-changer').on('click', function() { var $el = $(this) for (var i= 0; i < classNames.length; i++) { if ($el.hasClass(classNames[i]) && classNames[i+1]) { $el.removeClass(classNames[i]).addClass(classNames[i+1]); break; } } });\n",

      "The issue arises due to how jQuery handles event binding. When you bind a click event directly to a class using `$('.myClass').click(function () {...});`, the event listener is attached to the elements that have the class at the time of binding. If new elements acquire the class later, these elements will not automatically receive the click event listener.\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this, you should use event delegation. This involves binding the event to a parent element that contains all potential targets, allowing the event to be handled for any future elements that may acquire the desired class. In jQuery, this is accomplished using the `on()` method:\n",

      "```javascript\n",

      "  alert(\"alert\");\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the click event is bound to the `document` object, which ensures that any `.alert` elements, regardless of when they gain that class, will trigger the alert when clicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another common practice is to bind events to the `document` itself:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "$(document).on('click', '.myClass', function() {\n",
      "  // Your code here\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures that any elements acquiring the `.myClass` class at any point in time will have their click events handled appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "By employing event delegation, you avoid the limitation of direct event binding and ensure that your event handlers are responsive to dynamically changing class assignments.\n",

      "You have the following structure in main.js: $(document).ready(function(){ // this code is applied when `document.ready` fires` $(window).on('load', function(){ // this code is applied when `window.load` fires // if it was bound before `window.load` fired }); }) The code inside $(document).ready is not applied when your main.js is parsed, but when ready fires on $(document). $(document).ready() fires when DOM has finished building. (Basically wen the browser meets the </html> tag). $(window).load() fires when all resources (scripts, styles, images, ...) have finished loading. When document.ready event fires, the code inside that function is applied, while the browser continues to load resources. If the page is very light and the connection to the server very fast, window.load will fire before the browser finished applying the code from $(document)ready(...). So it might bind the listener on window.load after window.load already fired.

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue arises due to the order of execution and the nature of the events involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "$(document).ready() is a jQuery method that triggers a function once the Document Object Model (DOM) is fully loaded and ready for JavaScript manipulation. It's typically executed as soon as the HTML document's `<body>` or `<html>` element is fully parsed by the browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, $(window).on('load') attaches an event handler to the window object, which fires when the entire page, including all dependent resources like scripts, stylesheets, images, etc., have been completely loaded. This event may fire even after the DOM is fully ready because some resources might take longer to load than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your provided context, the code inside $(document).ready() doesn't execute until the DOM is ready, whereas the $(window).on('load') call is nested within that function. Therefore, the 'load' event listener is bound after the DOM is ready, potentially causing it to miss the 'load' event firing because it happens later.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure the 'load' event listener gets bound before the 'load' event occurs, you should move the binding of the 'load' event outside of the $(document).ready() function, like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "// Bind the 'load' event listener here, ensuring it's attached before the DOM is ready\n",
      "$(window).on('load', function() {\n",
      "  // Your code here\n",
      "});\n",
      "\n",
      "// The rest of your document-ready code remains unchanged\n",
      "$(document).ready(function() {\n",
      "  // This code executes once the DOM is ready\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, the 'load' event listener is guaranteed to be in place before the 'load' event fires, allowing your code to respond correctly to the completion of all page resources.\n",

      "What is the interaction of Garbage Collection with concurrent executing processes and threads?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes and no. if one of the threads calls garbage collection, will the un-referenced objects in other threads be collected also? Yes. Objects are not \"in threads\" -- there is a single object graph for all threads running in the program, so when GC happens, unreachable objects are collected regardless of which thread created them, or had local references to them. No. When a thread calls Runtime.gc() the VM is not obliged to actually do anything so it may be that no GC happens and no memory is collected. For example it has no effect when -XX:+DisableExplicitGC is specified at the command line. Runtime.gc() (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#gc%28%29) Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse. No. Even when a GC happens, not all unreachable objects that were only ever reachable from one thread's stack will necessarily be collected since generational GCs only deal with a subset of the object graph, and if that subset happens to contain all the unreachable objects created by a particular thread then it is only coincidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's only one Garbage Collector during the lifetime of a JVM. Consider reading this Java Garbage Collection Basics (https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/gc01/index.html) to get more info on GC. UPDATE: You write: \"The worker depends on the thread object, and the thread also depends on the worker\". So how does the GC can remove either of them if you can reach them at any moment (which means the objects can still be in use)? The objects will stay in memory untill they become unreachable. So in your case the Thread and the Worker will be garbage collected only when they both become unreachable from the root.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the garbage collector runs or not is JVM-specific behavior, but in most cases it will not (and I'll explain why when I talk about the OS). If you want to execute some operation on exit (such as a call to System.gc() to suggest that the garbage collector should run) then you can use the Runtime.addShutdownHook API. Note that this is a suggestion, and may not actually run the GC in all cases. At the end of System.exit(), Java will make an exit() syscall to Mac OS. When this happens, all threads in the Java process will be halted by the operating system and the pages of memory it was using will be deallocated by the OS. This is different than the deallocation that Java would run on an object, which frees up a (usually very small) piece of memory for the Java process to reuse, but Java still has total control over the memory and the OS cannot give it to another process. When the OS deallocates a page of memory, it means that there is now a physical region of memory that can be allocated by another process or the OS itself (for i.e. filesystem caching). Since the OS only allocates and deallocates memory by multiples of a page of memory (usually around 4k bytes) it can deallocate memory somewhat more quickly than Java (which may have many objects to process inside of a single page). The reason it doesn't make sense for Java to deallocate all the memory it's using before exiting (by running the GC on exit) is that once the program exits, it doesn't matter what was in those pages because nobody cares what data was last held in the Java process. The OS will ensure that any pages it allocates to a new process are scrubbed clean of the old data beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is that this depends on the garbage collection algorithms used. In some cases, you are correct that all threads are stopped during GC. In other cases, you are incorrect in that garbage collection proceeds while normal threads are running. To understand how GC's achieve that, you need a detailed understanding of the theory and terminology of garbage collectors, combined with an understanding of the specific collector. It is simply not amenable to a simple explanation. Oh yes, and it is worth pointing out that many modern collectors don't have a compaction phase per-se. Rather they work by copying live objects to a new \"space\" and zeroing the old \"space\" when they are done. If I am incorrect my question would be answered by a simple explanation of the strategy used to minimise blocking. If you really want to understand how garbage collectors work, I recommend: \"Garbage Collection: Algorithms for Automatic Dynamic Memory Management\" (https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0471941484) by Richard Jones. \"The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management\" (https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1420082795) by Richard Jones, Antony Hosking and Eliot Moss ... and beware that finding accurate, detailed, public descriptions of the internals of production garbage collectors is not easy. (Though in the case of the Hotspot GC's, you can look at the source code ...) EDIT: in response to the OP's comment ... \"It seems it is as I thought -- there is no getting around the \"stop the world\" part.\" It depends. In the case of the Java 6 Concurrent Collector (http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html#cms), there are two pauses during the marking of the roots (including stacks), and then marking / copying of other objects proceeds in parallel. For other kinds of concurrent collector, read or write barriers are used while the collector is running to trap situations where the collector and application threads would otherwise interfere with each other. I don't have my copy of [Jones] here right now, but I also recall that it is possible to make the \"stop the world\" interval negligible ... at the cost of more expensive pointer operations and/or not collecting all garbage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very short version of answers are: What is java garbage collection all about? GC is a mechanism of memory management where the system (the JVM in this case) is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. How is it implemented? There are various ways to implement it. A simple description is that each piece of memory that is allocated is tracked. periodically the system checks the allocated pieces to see if any part of the program (the variables) can still reach the memory. Any memory that cannot be reached is reclaimed. When and how is it called ? This is also left up to the implementation. The only guarantee you have in Java is that before an OutOfMemoryError is thrown the system will attempt to reclaim memory. I would expect that most GC implementations also try to do a collection before they ask the underlying operating system for more memory. In general there will be a background thread that deals with running the collector. What algorithms if follows in order to reclaim memory ?? There are several possible ones. Look at the articles others have posted as a starting point for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this memory is released? by garbage collector or by native thread? None. It is released by the OS... How java process signals to the OS that this memory segment isn't used any more? ... when the thread terminates. The JVM does nothing here but use the native thread API which in turns uses the OS primitives. And... How this memory affected is the thread was terminated but his corresponding object still has references from other live object? ... this on the other hand is the role of the JVM; of the GC specifically. Note that creating a Thread (or Runnable or Callable) does not actually create a thread at the OS level; you have to run it for that (using .start() for a Thread, etc etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "A thread wont be garbage collected until it has finished, so if your threads never finish, they will not be available for garbage collection. As noted by fge in the comments, often times the thread will have reference to the enclosing object, which will of course prevent the thread from being garbage collected. As for knowing if an object is on its way to be collected, this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4223956/check-if-object-can-be-fetched-by-garbage-collector?rq=1) answer has some nice details on what you can(and can't) do. Other than that, you can suggest the jvm to run garbage collection with system.gc(), but there is no guarantee the jvm will run the garbage collector.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, not necessarily. All that really means is that some of your objects can be collected. You could still have a garbage leak if, for example, the instance count always went down after a GC but not quite to the same level as before; if this \"baseline\" increased over time you'd run out of memory occasionally. Also, it's very hard to prove a negative, so it could be that your application does have a memory leak bug, but this specific situation isn't exercising it. Let's clarify one thing - you can never force the JVM to run garbage collection. The best you can do is call System.gc(), which is a hint to the JVM that it might want to run GC now. It doesn't have to do anything, and a no-op implementation of that method would be perfectly valid. Basically, garbage collection \"just happens\" and the less you place specific expectations on it the better. So basically, yes, it will typically only run when needed. Again, this is typically internal knowledge and the details will depend on which garbage collector implementation you're using. For Sun's JVM, however, you can use the command-line argument -verbose:gc to get verbose garbage collection details output to the console. If you want to inspect the details programmatically or visually, this information might be exposed via JMX too (i.e. set up your process to use JMX remoting (http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html), and connect to it with JConsole). For me, using Sun's 1.5.0_06 JVM, I see an MBean in java.lang.GarbageCollector that exposes some information including the time of the last full GC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact behavior here depends entirely on the JVM implementation. In spec (that is what a proper JVM implementation needs to provide you), it can happen in parallel, it can happen first before your code executes, or it can not happen at all. In practice, my observation on JVMs I have happened to observe is that it runs immediately in a separate thread. However, in some cases multiple calls spawn multiple threads, sometimes it queues the requests on one thread. The Garbage collection launched was always a \"stop-the-world\" type (that is it was very complete and slowed or paused the application). However, given your comment to @Chris Dail, your underlying problem isn't the behavior of a System.gc() call. Calling System.gc() can have some uses. It can be used clear memory so you can get a sense of how large the footprint of the application actually is currently. It can also be used as a strategy to ensure that a stop-the-world garbage collection happens earlier so that it \"stops the world\" for a shorter amount of time because there is less memory to clear. (I should note that as JVM's get more and more sophisticated this kind of thing is less and less necessary, and actually becomes counter-productive). What it does not do however, is in any way solve an OutOfMemoryError. The JVM will not give you an OutOfMemoryError until it has garbage collected to the best of its ability. Calling System.gc does not change that. If you have an OutOfMemoryError it is likely because you are holding reference to objects in ways that you don't really need, but that are preventing those Objects memory from being reclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the garbage collector decides to collect differs per garbage collector. I have not been able to find any hard promises on when your (Parallel GC) garbage collector runs. Many Garbage collectors also tune on several different variables, which can influence when it will run. As you have noted yourself, your application can have high heap usage and still run fine. What you are looking for in an application is that the Garbage Collector is still efficient. Meaning it can clean up quiet a lot of garbage in a single run. Some aspects of garbage collection Most garbage collectors have two or more strategies, one for 'young' objects and one for 'old' objects. When a young object has not been collected in the latest (several) collects, it becomes an old object. The idea behind this is that if an object has not been collected it probably wont be collected next time either. (Most objects either live really short, or really long). The garbage collector does a very efficient, but not perfect cleaning of the young objects. When that doesn't free up enough data, then a more costly garbage collection is done on all (young en old) objects. This will often generate a saw tooth (taken from this site (http://what-when-how.com/jboss-as-5-performance-tuning/tuning-the-java-virtual-machine-jboss-as-5-part-4/)): (https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGoJI.jpg) Here you see many small drops in heap size and a slowly growing heap. Every now and then a large collection is done, and there is a large drop. The actually 'used' memory is the amount of memory left after a large collection. Aspects to measure This leads to the following aspects you can look at when determining the health of your application: The amount of time spent by you application garbage collecting (both in total and as a percentage of CPU time). The amount of memory available right after a garbage collect. The a quick increment in the number of large garbage collects. In most cases you will need monitor the behavior of your application under load, to see what are good values for you. The parallel garbage collector uses a similar condition (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/parallel.html) to determine if all is still well: If more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, then an OutOfMemoryError is thrown. All of these statistic you can see nicely using VisualVM and Jconsole. I am not sure which you can use as triggers in your monitoring tools\n",

      "\n",
      "Garbage collection (GC) interacts with concurrent executing processes and threads in a few key ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Single Object Graph**: All threads share a single object graph, meaning that objects created and referenced by any thread are part of the same heap. Therefore, when GC occurs, unreachable objects across all threads are eligible for collection, regardless of their originating thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Runtime.gc() Method**: Calling `Runtime.gc()` does not guarantee that GC will occur. It merely suggests to the JVM that it might want to perform a GC cycle. JVMs like HotSpot may ignore such suggestions, especially when `-XX:+DisableExplicitGC` is enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pauses During Root Marking**: In some collectors, such as the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector, there are pauses during the marking of roots (including thread stacks), but subsequent collection of other objects can proceed concurrently.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Read and Write Barriers**: Certain concurrent collectors employ read and write barriers to manage interference between the GC and application threads, allowing them to coexist without significant performance impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **No Guarantees on When GC Runs**: The timing of GC execution varies based on the collector's design and tuning parameters. It can run concurrently, before the application starts, or not at all, depending on the configuration and load.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Thread Termination and Object Reachability**: A thread won't be garbage collected until it finishes execution, as long as it holds references to live objects. Conversely, objects referenced solely by terminated threads remain unreachable and can be collected.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **System.gc() Limitations**: Using `System.gc()` to force GC is generally discouraged due to lack of guarantees and potential performance overhead. Instead, focus on optimizing memory usage and ensuring proper object lifecycle management within your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, GC operates on the shared heap, considering all threads equally. While some collectors allow for concurrent GC, others necessitate periodic \"stop-the-world\" pauses for comprehensive garbage collection. The exact behavior depends on the JVM implementation and its configured garbage collector. Proper understanding and tuning of GC mechanisms are crucial for managing memory efficiently in multi-threaded applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am pretty sure that this is a problem with how you are serving static files in express. From the express docs: app.use('/static', express.static('public')) Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory from the /static path prefix. http://localhost:3000/static/images/kitten.jpg (http://localhost:3000/static/images/kitten.jpg) http://localhost:3000/static/css/style.css (http://localhost:3000/static/css/style.css) http://localhost:3000/static/js/app.js (http://localhost:3000/static/js/app.js) http://localhost:3000/static/images/bg.png (http://localhost:3000/static/images/bg.png) http://localhost:3000/static/hello.html (http://localhost:3000/static/hello.html) However, the path that you provide to the express.static function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, it’s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve: app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))) Your code has the following for serve static: app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build'))); So if I am reading this correctly, as I look at your code, I would understand that to be the following: When you have an request that comes in for /, the rest of the call will search within client/build for the data. In your case, for your get request to /api/item/:id, that would probably be read by your server to try and find a static file in client/build/api/item/:whatevertheitemidis. Instead, to serve static files, I would perhaps consider putting them in a directory called 'public' or something, and change your serve static to something like: app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(//Wherever you keep your static files))); With this all said, I may have been mistaken regarding some of the nuances of express.static so be sure to checkout the documentation (https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/serve-static.html). Either way, I hope to at least have pointed you in the right direction. If you comment out your serve static line and make a request with postman, you should see it working as expected. UPDATE I took a look at your code and noticed a couple of things: I just pulled down your code and the endpoints are working. I tried http://localhost:5000/api/data and it provided the expected data. It looks like your problem with serving static assets -- such as your favicon -- is because of the %PUBLIC_URL%/ part of your favicon url in your html. So far as I can find, there is nothing in your code that would translate that to an actual route. As soon as I turned that to /favicon, everything started working as expected.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue lies in the way Node.js and Express.js handle file paths when serving static files. By default, `express.static` uses the directory from which the application is launched as the base directory for serving static files. This means that any paths specified in the HTML or other resources will be resolved relative to that base directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your application is launched from a different directory than where your static files are located, you'll encounter issues accessing those files. To resolve this, you can either:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use an Absolute Path:**\n",
      "   You can specify the full path to the directory containing your static files. For example, if your project structure looks like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - my-project/\n",
      "     - server.js\n",
      "     - public/\n",
      "       - images/\n",
      "         - background.png\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   You can use:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   const path = require('path');\n",
      "   app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use Relative Paths Carefully:**\n",
      "   If you prefer to use relative paths, ensure they are correct based on the directory from which your application is launched. For instance, if your application is launched from the `my-project` directory, and your static files are in the `public` subdirectory, you can use:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   app.use('/public', express.static('public'));\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   However, if your application is launched from a different directory, this won't work as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Avoid Using Environment Variables:**\n",
      "   The `%PUBLIC_URL%` environment variable is typically used in Create React App projects to help manage the build output directory. If you're not using Create React App, avoid using this variable in your static file paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Explicitly Serve Each File:**\n",
      "   While possible, explicitly serving each file using `res.sendFile()` is not recommended due to the additional overhead and lack of benefits compared to using `express.static`. It's better to organize your files properly and use `express.static` for serving entire directories.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key is to ensure that the path you provide to `express.static` is correct and consistent with the directory from which your application is launched. Using absolute paths or carefully managing relative paths can help resolve the issue of not being able to access and serve directories located above the current directory.\n",

This is the earliest possible time that you can change the DOM with JavaScript, so it's widely used.

Images, Flash, and some scripts, but usually not stylesheets. Use this for code that should run only when the page won't change any more. Also, with window.onload you can only attach one listener, but you can attach as many as you want with jQuery ready. To attach more than one event on window.onload, use addEventListener: window.addEventListener('load', function () { }, false);\n",

The second approach will however ensure that (in most cases), any scripts, HTML, or other resources (which the JavaScript defined in that function might depend on) are loaded and present before that function is invoked.\n",

The first option in your code example loads it asynchronously with no predictable order relative to the other things on your page. Asynchronous loading has the advantage that nothing in the page waits for the script to load and the page can render before the script finishes loading. Asynchronous loading has the disadvantage that you can only know when it's loaded and available for use if you either monitor a load event for that script or if it calls you when it loads and runs or if you poll for some artifact that it makes available when it runs. Synchronous loading (using <script> tags has the advantage that scripts load in a predictable order so you can load library scripts first and then scripts that use those libraries and know that they will be loaded in the desired order without any special coding.

All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent: $( document ).ready( handler ) $().ready( handler ) (this is not recommended) $( handler ) and The handler passed to .ready() is guaranteed to be executed after the DOM is ready, so this is usually the best place to attach all other event handlers and run other jQuery code.

      "If you don't use the async or defer attributes (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#attr-script-async) on script elements, the browser runs JavaScript code that is not inside a function as it encounters it while parsing the document. If there are multiple script elements it runs them in order. And code that is inside a function may still be run without a specific event triggering it if the function is called directly, e.g. the following will define a function and then call it immediately: <script> function test() { alert(\"Test\"); } test(); </script> Executing script elements in order is an important, predictable behaviour of the browser, because if a script element in the middle of the document happens to do something like a document.write() then whatever is written will appear where the script element was. And if the script attempts to manipulate other elements in the document it will only have access to elements above the script because the ones below haven't been parsed yet. Also JS in any given script has access to global functions and variables declared in earlier script elements. \"I feel like it would probably be one of the window/document onload events\" It's not. Those events will call functions that are explicitly bound to them, if any are. Other code like you've shown in your question and I've shown above will run before the onload event. The async and defer attributes change things a bit, on browsers that support them. They only relate to script tags that refer to external JavaScript resources, e.g.: <script async src=\"my.js\"></script> A full discussion of them is off-topic for this answer, but: Using either async or defer will allow the HTML parser to continue building the page without waiting for the JavaScript code to be run first Scripts using async may be executed out of order, and are run as soon as they are available Scripts using defer will be executed in order when the parser has finished building the page You can't use both on the same script tag; if you do, async wins\n",

You should be functions in here that you need to run when the page first loads, so generally initialization of plugins, first run functions and attaching events to elements. Any other functions that can run after the page has loaded can be defined outside of this scope.

This happens event fires when your browser's \"Stop\" -icon becomes gray, so to speak. This is very useful to detect when the document along with all its contents are loaded. $(document).ready(); This on the other hand will fire as soon as the web browser is capable of running your JavaScript, which happens after the parser is done with the DOM. This is useful if you want to execute JavaScript as soon as possible. $(window).unload(); This event will be fired when you are navigating off the page.

Is this approach recommended OR we should ideally have only 1 $(document).ready ? It is OK to do it like that. If you can have them in the same block code it would be easier to manage, but that's all there is to it.

      "There are several methods for sequencing the execution of jQuery functions, each with its own use case depending on whether you want the code to run immediately or wait until certain elements are fully loaded. Here are the main methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immediate Execution**:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   (function() {\n",
      "       // Code to be executed immediately\n",
      "   })();\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This executes the code as soon as it is encountered during the parsing phase of the document. It is useful for code that doesn't depend on the DOM being ready, such as setting up event listeners for UI elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Document Ready**:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   $(document).ready(function() {\n",
      "       // Code to be executed after the DOM is fully loaded\n",
      "   });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This ensures that the code runs only after the HTML document has been completely parsed and the DOM is ready for manipulation. It is commonly used for initializing components, binding events, and performing operations that require the presence of DOM elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Equivalent shorthand forms include:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   $(function() {\n",
      "       // Code to be executed after the DOM is fully loaded\n",
      "   });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   and\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   (function($) {\n",
      "       $(document).ready(function() {\n",
      "           // Code to be executed after the DOM is fully loaded\n",
      "       });\n",
      "   })($);\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Window Load**:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   $(window).load(function() {\n",
      "       // Code to be executed after the entire page, including images, subframes, and objects, is fully loaded\n",
      "   });\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This is similar to `window.onload` in plain JavaScript. It ensures that all resources, including images, stylesheets, and other scripts, are fully loaded before executing the provided callback. It is useful for operations that depend on all assets being present, such as resizing elements based on image dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Asynchronous Script Loading**:\n",
      "   ```html\n",
      "   <script src=\"path/to/script.js\" async></script>\n",
      "   <script src=\"path/to/script.js\" defer></script>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   These attributes control how the browser loads external JavaScript files. `async` allows the script to download in parallel with other resources and execute as soon as it is available, while `defer` defers execution until the document has been fully parsed.

      "To resolve the issue with your TypeScript application using Webpack for compilation, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Correct the typo in your `webpack.config.js` file by changing `module.loader` to `module.loaders`. This property is used to specify loaders for different file types.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add the following configuration to handle TypeScript files:\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "const path = require('path');\n",
      "\n",
      "module.exports = {\n",

      "3. Install the necessary dependencies for handling TypeScript files:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli typescript ts-loader @types/webpack\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript compiler options:\n",
      "```json\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"compilerOptions\": {\n",
      "    \"target\": \"es5\",\n",

      "Should JavaScript be consolidated into a single minified bundle for the entire website, or should each page have its own tailored minified bundle?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing wrong with creating a bundle for each page, in fact, it is probably the best approach for your problem. Circumventing it would create more work, you would need to implement your own minification and compilation optimiser, just to support a subset of your JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please provide your best answer below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "For most modern web applications, it's generally recommended to use a combination of both strategies rather than strictly adhering to one. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Single Minified Bundle:** This is beneficial for reducing the initial load time of the website because all necessary JavaScript files are bundled together and sent as a single request to the client. This can significantly improve performance by decreasing the number of HTTP requests needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tailored Bundles per Page:** On the other hand, having separate bundles for different pages allows for more granular control over the JavaScript that gets loaded on each page. It ensures that only the essential code for each specific page is included, which can reduce the overall size of the bundle sent to the client. This is particularly useful when certain features or modules aren't used across all pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Code Splitting:** Implementing dynamic imports or using a module bundler like Webpack can enable code splitting, allowing you to split your application into smaller chunks that load on-demand. This way, users don't have to wait for scripts they won't use to download initially.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading can also be employed to defer the loading of non-critical resources until they're needed, further improving performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** In SSR, the server sends fully rendered HTML to the client, and JavaScript handles subsequent interactions. In CSR, the browser first renders a lightweight shell, then dynamically fetches and executes JavaScript to enhance the UI. The choice between these rendering strategies can influence how you structure your JavaScript bundles.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilizing tools like PurgeCSS or Tree Shaking can help remove unused code from your final bundle, ensuring that only the necessary parts of your codebase end up being delivered to users.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Considerations:** Factors such as the size of your application, the nature of user interactions, and performance requirements should guide your decision. For small applications or those with straightforward navigation, a single bundle might suffice. For larger, more complex sites, a hybrid approach with multiple tailored bundles may be preferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while it's possible to create a single monolithic bundle, leveraging both single and tailored bundles strategically can lead to better performance, reduced payload sizes, and improved user\n",

You can see a working example for both here: http://jsfiddle.net/je9w1n9m/ (http://jsfiddle.net/je9w1n9m/) But I think your issue is more about how your caching headers are set-up for static content. If you have caching headers set-up right on your web server to tell the browser to cache the static content, then the image will return a 304 Not Modified response, and will be cached in the browser from the first time it loads.\n",

As such, I settled for replacing the image object. I would create a new image object, set the onload handler, set the .src value and then when it loads, insert it into the page in place of the existing image. When creating an image from scratch in javascript, you do this: var img = new Image(); img.onload = function() { // put your onload code here }; img.src = \"xxx.jpg\" If you just want to change the .src of an image, you just find the DOM object in the page and set it's .src property. var img = document.getElementById(\"myImage\"); img.src = \"xxx.jpg\"; If you want to try to capture the onload event when resetting the .src (what I had reliability problems with a couple years ago, you would do this: var img = document.getElementById(\"myImage\"); img.onload = function() { // your code here }; img.src = \"xxx.jpg\"; If you want to load a new image and replace an existing one with it when it loads, you would do this: function replaceImg(oldImage, newSrc) { var img = new Image(); img.onload = function() { var parent = oldImage.parentNode; parent.insertBefore(img, oldImage); parent.removeChild(oldImage); // put any other code you want here when the // replacement image is loaded and in place }; img.src = newSrc; } And, you would call this like this: <img id=\"myImage\" src=\"yyy.jpg\"> var oldImage = document.getElementById(\"myImage\"); replaceImg(oldImage, \"xxx.jpg\");\n",

      "If you want to update the image element after it has been added to the document, you'll have to have some way of referencing it.

      "Retrieve a variable's value from one class instance while operating within a different class instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not generally possible for an instance that is assigned as an attribute of some other instance to get a reference to the containing instance. For one thing, there may be zero or more than one such references! For example, if you created a second instance of OuterClass with the same InnerClass instance, there would be two potentially different variable attributes that you might want to read. In general, if you want to access a object's attributes you need a reference to the object first. It having a reference to you is not enough, unless you arrange some alternative API. For instance, maybe the InnerClass expects to get a reference to OuterClass in its test method, and OuterClass gets a method to pass itself in: class InnerClass: def test(self, outer): return outer.variable class OuterClass: def __init__(self, inner, variable): self.inner = inner self.variable = variable def run_test(self): return self.inner.test(self) out = OuterClass(InnerClass(), \"foo\") print(out.run_test()) You could also have your classes set up circular references, where they each reference each other. Then either one could do stuff with the other: class InnerClass: def __init__(self): self.outer = None def test(self): if self.outer is None: raise ValueError(\"Not in an OuterClass instance!\") return self.outer.variable class OuterClass: def __init__(self, inner, variable): self.inner = inner inner.outer = self # set reference back to us! self.variable = variable out = OuterClass(InnerClass(), \"foo\") print(out.inner.test()) This is a very crude version of this sort of approach, you might want to ensure your references remained consistent (preventing the same InnerClass instance being used by two different OuterClass instance, for example). Note that circular references like this make the garbage collector's work harder. Normally Python objects get cleaned up immediately after their last reference goes away. But objects with reference cycles always have references going between each other, and so the GC needs to check if the whole set of objects is dead all together. It will probably manage it pretty well for a cycle that contains just two objects like this example, but a in a larger data structure it might be more tricky.\n",
      "\n",
      "This question has been asked times and times again - and is nothing Python-specific. To call a method on an instance of another class, you need to have a reference to this instance. The very obvious solution is to pass this reference, either at call time: class A(object): def __init__(self, var_a): self.var_a = var_a def method(self, another_object): return another_object.another_method(self.var_a) class B(object): def __init__(self, var_b): self.var_b = var_b def another_method(self, var): return self.var_b + var a = A(42) b = B(1138) print a.method(b) or at instanciation time: class A(object): def __init__(self, var_a, another_object): self.var_a = var_a self.another_object = another_object def method(self): return self.another_object.another_method(self.var_a) class B(object): def __init__(self, var_b): self.var_b = var_b def another_method(self, var): return self.var_b + var b = b(1138) a = A(b) print a.method() Note that in both cases, B doesn't need to know about class A - it just gets an instance as param and that's it. So if A and B live in different modules, the module containing B doesn't have to import the one containing A: # module b.py class B(object): def __init__(self, var_b): self.var_b = var_b def another_method(self, var): return self.var_b + var # module a.py from b import B class A(object): def __init__(self, var_a, another_object): self.var_a = var_a self.another_object = another_object def method(self): return self.another_object.another_method(self.var_a) if __name__ == \"__main__\": b = b(1138) a = A(b) print a.method() which avoids the circular import error you obviously have given your traceback.\n",

If you've created a plain Java project in Eclipse, with a module-info.java at it's source path root, then you need to add all the required jars to the module path: JavaFX SDK should already be installed on your system, or download it from Gluon (https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) and unzip it Right-click your Java project, got to Build Path -> Configure Build Path... Go to Libraries tab, point to the Modulepath section Click [Add External JARs...] button, pick all the jars from JavaFX SDK, hit [Apply and close] (https://i.stack.imgur.com/17Ime.png) Then suggestions should work as expected, and imports will be automatically inserted at the top of your java files, but they will appear in error the first time you import anything from a given library module, as this module must also be required in your module-info.java. You can do that automatically with a quick fix (\"Add 'requires javafx.something' to module-info.java\") when hovering the import. Now there's a more straightforward way to create a JavaFX modular project in Eclipse, using Maven: Create a new Maven Project Check and pass the first wizard screen Select archetype org.openjfx:javafx-archetype-fxml On the next screen, you can select the JavaFX version of your choice (currently 13 by default) After the wizard terminates, you've got a nice little project already setup with an application window and two FXML sample displays.

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue lies in your use of the dictionary `hash`. You're trying to use it as a boolean flag, but Python's dictionaries don't support this directly. When you try to check if `hash[temp]` equals 1, you're actually trying to access the value associated with key `4` in your dictionary, but since there is no such key, a `KeyError` is raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your current approach, you're trying to solve the \"Two Sum\" problem, where you need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. Your current implementation has a few issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You're using `hash[i] = 0` instead of `hash[i] = True` or any other non-zero/non-None value. This means that when you later check `if hash[temp]`, it will always be `False` (or `0`), leading to incorrect results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. You're not correctly handling the case where the target can be formed by the same number twice (e.g., `[3, 3]` for a target of `6`).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a corrected version of your function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def twoSum(nums, target):\n",
      "    hash = {}\n",
      "    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n",
      "        complement = target - num\n",
      "        if complement in hash:\n",
      "            return (num, complement)\n",
      "        hash[num] = None\n",
      "    return None\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version of the function works as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It iterates over each number in the input list `nums`, along with its index `i`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For each number, it calculates the `complement` (i.e., `target - num`).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If the `complement` is already in the dictionary `hash`, it means we've found a pair that adds up to the target, so we return the pair `(num, complement)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If the `complement` is not in the dictionary, we add the current number to the dictionary with a value of `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. If no pair is found after checking all numbers, the function returns `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it efficient for large inputs.\n",

      "I'm having trouble decoding protocol buffers transmitted via RabbitMQ.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As suggested by Luke Bakken here (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pika-python/rryGk-54FsQ/T1gfo8-qCgAJ), this does the trick: import pika def handle(channel, method, properties, body): message = body.decode() print(\"received:\", message) connection = pika.BlockingConnection() channel = connection.channel() with connection, channel: message = \"hello\" next(channel.consume(queue=\"amq.rabbitmq.reply-to\", auto_ack=True, inactivity_timeout=0.1)) channel.basic_publish( exchange=\"\", routing_key=\"test\", body=message.encode(), properties=pika.BasicProperties(reply_to=\"amq.rabbitmq.reply-to\")) print(\"sent:\", message) for (method, properties, body) in channel.consume( queue=\"amq.rabbitmq.reply-to\", auto_ack=True): handle(channel, method, properties, body)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, I found following solution: def receive(): parameters = pika.ConnectionParameters(RabbitMQ_server) connection = pika.BlockingConnection(parameters) channel = connection.channel() channel.queue_declare(queue='toM') method_frame, header_frame, body = channel.basic_get(queue = 'toM') if method_frame.NAME == 'Basic.GetEmpty': connection.close() return '' else: channel.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method_frame.delivery_tag) connection.close() return body\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the following multi-threaded consumer to solve this problem. import pika import time import sys import threading from Queue import Queue rabbitmq_server = \"<RABBITMQ_SERVER_IP>\" queue = \"hello1\" connection = None def check_acknowledge(channel, connection, ack_queue): delivery_tag = None while(True): try: delivery_tag = ack_queue.get_nowait() channel.basic_ack(delivery_tag=delivery_tag) break except: connection.process_data_events() time.sleep(1) def process_message(body, delivery_tag, ack_queue): print \"Received %s\" % (body) print \"Waiting for 600 seconds before receiving next ID\\n\" start = time.time() elapsed = 0 while elapsed < 300: elapsed = time.time() - start print \"loop cycle time: %f, seconds count: %02d\" %(time.clock(), elapsed) time.sleep(1) ack_queue.put(delivery_tag) def callback(ch, method, properties, body): global connection ack_queue = Queue() t = threading.Thread(target=process_message, args=(body, method.delivery_tag, ack_queue)) t.start() check_acknowledge(ch, connection, ack_queue) while True: try: connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=rabbitmq_server)) channel = connection.channel() print ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C' channel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1) channel.basic_consume(callback, queue=queue) channel.start_consuming() except KeyboardInterrupt: break channel.close() connection.close() exit(0) The consumer callback function triggers a separate function check_acknowledge in the main thread itself. Due to this, connection and channel objects are retained in the same thread. Note that Pika is not thread-safe so we need to maintain these objects in the same thread. The actual processing happens in a new thread spawned off the main. Once process_message is done with its processing, it puts the delivery_tag in the queue. check_acknowledge loops indefinitely till it finds the delivery_tag put in the queue by process_message. Once it does find, it acks the message and returns. I have tested this implementation by running this consumer by sleeping for 5 min, 10 mins, 30 mins and an hour. This is working very well for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should be using the latest version of Pika, to start with. When you set no_ack=True (auto_ack=True in Pika 1.0) RabbitMQ considers the message acknowledged when it is delivered. This means that every message that your consumer has in memory (or in the TCP stack) when you stop it will be lost because RabbitMQ considers it acknowledged. You should use no_ack=False (the default) and acknowledge messages in handle_delivery once your work is done. Please note that if your work takes a long time you should do it in another thread to prevent blocking Pika's I/O loop. See the following documentation: https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html (https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html) NOTE: the RabbitMQ team monitors the rabbitmq-users mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users) and only sometimes answers questions on StackOverflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "When using Pika (https://github.com/pika/pika) the channel.confirm_delivery() flag needs to be set before you start publishing messages. This is important so that Pika will confirm that each message has been sent successfully before sending the next message. This will however increase the time it takes to send messages to RabbitMQ (http://www.rabbitmq.com/), as delivery needs to be confirmed before the program can proceed with the next message. channel.confirm_delivery() try: for index in xrange(10): channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World #%s!' % index) print('Total Messages Sent: %s' % x) except pika.exceptions.ConnectionClosed as exc: print('Error. Connection closed, and the message was never delivered.') basic_publish will return a Boolean depending if the message was sent or not. But, it is important to catch potential exceptions in case the connection is closed during transfer and handle it appropriately. As in those cases the exception will interrupt the flow of the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems, that the easiest way is to bind the python queue to the exchange in RabbitMq management. After doing it I've sucessfully recieved the messages. PyhonConsumer now looks the following way: import pika print('Stating consumer') connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host='localhost')) channel = connection.channel() channel.queue_declare('python_consumer_1') print ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C' def callback(ch, method, properties, body): print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,) ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag) channel.queue_bind(queue='python_consumer_1', exchange='MyApp.Transit:SimpleTextMessage') channel.basic_consume(callback, queue='python_consumer_1') channel.start_consuming()\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found a workaround. I checking every X sec if my PikaClient has consumed messages. If not I restart the application that will create automatically a queue.

      "You can declare a priority queue using pika. channel.queue_declare('queue_name', {''x-max-priority': 10}) To send a message with priority channel.basic_publish(exchange='exchange_name', routing_key='routing_key', body='Messsage', properties=BasicProperties(priority=1)) You can set the priority value between 1 to 10, i.e. the maximum priority value that you have set. You can set a maximum priority value of 255, but RabbitMQ recommends the maximum value to be 10. Reference (https://www.rabbitmq.com/priority.html) To consume the message, you define a callback function and call the basic_consume method def callback(ch, method, properties, body): # Getting the message message = body.decode() ## Do the logic print('Received message {}'.format(message)) # Sending acknowledgment back ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag) channel.basic_consume(callback, queue='queue_name') The consumer for a priority queue is the same as the consumer for a normal queue. When you set a priority the messages get reordered based on the priority at the broker side. So you consume the messages normally without getting bothered about the messages. Note: You cannot redeclare a queue as a priority queue. You gotta delete the old queue and declare the new one as a priority queue.\n",

      "Your script works fine. I pushed a message to a queue called simple_queue using the exchange ProgressNotification and your script printed. b'Hello World!'

      "This is simply a case of you needing to extract the data in a more specific manner. You have 2 options really: Option 1: (In my opinion the better, as it is faster and less resource heavy.) import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs headers = {'Accept': '*/*', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683 Safari/537.36 OPR/57.0.3098.91'} res = requests.get(\"https://augustasymphony.com/event/top-of-the-world/\", headers=headers) soup = bs(res.text, \"lxml\") event_header = soup.find(\"h2\", {\"class\": \"rhino-event-header\"}).text.strip() time = soup.find(\"p\", {\"class\": \"rhino-event-time\"}).text.strip() You can use requests quite simply to find the data as shown in the code above specifically selecting the data you want and perhap saving it in a dictionary. This is the normal way to go about it. It may contain a lot of scripts in the page, however the page doesn't require JavaScript to load said data dynamically. Option2: You continue using selenium and can collect the entire body information of the page using one of multiple selections. driver.find_element_by_id('wrapper').get_attribute('innerHTML') # Entire body driver.find_element_by_id('tribe-events').get_attribute('innerHTML') # the events list driver.find_element_by_id('rhino-event-single-content').get_attribute('innerHTML') # the single event This second option is a lot more just taking the whole html and dumping it. Personally I would go with the first option creating dictionaries of the cleaned data. Edit: To futher illustrate my example import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs headers = {'Accept': '*/*', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683 Safari/537.36 OPR/57.0.3098.91'} res = requests.get(\"https://augustasymphony.com/event/\", headers=headers) soup = bs(res.text, \"lxml\") seedlist = {a[\"href\"] for a in soup.find(\"div\", {\"id\": \"tribe-events-content-wrapper\"}).find_all(\"a\") if '?ical=1' not in a[\"href\"]} for seed in seedlist: res = requests.get(seed, headers=headers) soup = bs(res.text, \"lxml\") data = dict() data['event_header'] = soup.find(\"h2\", {\"class\": \"rhino-event-header\"}).text.strip() data['time'] = soup.find(\"p\", {\"class\": \"rhino-event-time\"}).text.strip() print(data) Here I am generting a seedlist of event urls and then going into each one to find information.\n",

      "I suspect that the correct time is renderd by js because if you disable the js in your brwser you'll get the same results as with your python script. Usually when parsing dynamic content the solution is selenium or similar clients, but in this case there is a unix timestamp in your tag's attruibutes (data-unix), which we can use to get the correct time. import datetime import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup r = requests.get('http://hltv.org/matches') sauce = r.text soup = BeautifulSoup(sauce, 'lxml') matchlinks_um = [] for links in soup.find(class_=\"standard-headline\", text=(datetime.date.today())).find_parent().find_all( class_=\"upcoming-match\"): matchlinks_um.append('https://hltv.org' + links.get('href')) for link in matchlinks_um: r = requests.get(link) soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'lxml') a = soup.find('div', class_='time')['data-unix'] t = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(int(a[:10])).time() print(t) Note that t is a datetime.time object, but you could easily convert it to a string if you like. Also when parsing html it's best to use .text (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-content) because it holds the decoded content. But even if the tag had no 'data-unix' attribute, we could still get the correct time by adding one hour to the value of the tag's text with timedelta (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta). For example: s = '15:30' dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(s, '%H:%M') + datetime.timedelta(hours=1) t = dt.time() print(t) #16:30:00 s is a string with value '15:30' (H:M format), like those we get from the website. When we pass this string to strptime (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) we get a datetime object, so now we can add one hour with timedelta. dt is a datetime object with value 1900-01-01 16:30:00 (15:30 + 1 hour). By calling the .time (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.time) method we get a datetime.time object. t is a datetime.time (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.time) object with value 16:30:00. You could get the hour with t.hour (integer), or do more calculations or convert it to string or keep it as it is. The pont is that t is s + 1 hour. About the 'data-unix' attribute, I don't know if it's a standard attribute (first time I see it), so I don't think you'll find it in any other websites.\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: stop using combineReducers and pass your reducer to createStore directly. Use import reducer from './foo' instead of import * from './foo'. Example with default import/export, no combineReducers: // foo.js function reducer(state, action) { return state; } export default reducer; ---- // index.js import myReducer from './foo'; Example with combineReducers // foo.js export default (state, action) => { ... } ---- // bar.js export default (state, action) => { ... } ---- // index.js import foo from './foo'; import bar from './bar'; const store = createStore(combineReducers({ foo, bar, }); The second argument of createStore (preloaded state) must have the same object structure as your combined reducers. combineReducers takes an object, and applies each reducer that is provided in the object to the corresponding state property. Now you are exporting your reducer using export default, which is transpiled to something like module.exports.default = yourReducer. When you import the reducer, you get module.exports, which is equal to {default: yourReducer}. Your preloaded state doesn't have a default property thus redux complains. If you use import reducer from './blabla' you get module.exports.default instead which is equal to your reducer. Here's more info on how ES6 module system works from MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export). Reading combineReducers (https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html) docs from redux may also help.\n",
      "\n",
      "After much reviewing, debugging and asking other devs, in a nutshell this is the problem I was facing: The reducer and how it was being imported into a main \"manifest\" file to manage all other reducers. Basically, since I was only using one reducer in this project, there was no need for a manifest reducer file. See below: import { combineReducers } from 'redux'; import Reducer from './reducer'; const rootReducer = combineReducers({ state: Reducer }); export default rootReducer; I don't know exactly why this was nesting state. Perhaps because, theoretically, we would be dealing with multiple reducers with different purposes (like a data reducer and a user reducer) and would need to nest those into our state tree to manage. state = { // here is one nested reducer with its own properties data: { type: // somevalue, filtered: true }, // here is another user: { name: // somename, password: // somepassword } }; In short...be mindful of how your reducer is being imported into your createStore function and if it's the only reducer being used or if there's multiple reducers being run through a manifest file of sorts. Cheers.\n",

      "You didn't create the store instead you are trying to export the reducer. In the combinedReducers.js: import {createStore, combineReducers} from 'redux'; const rootReducer = combineReducers({ storeKey: key, }) const store = createStore(rootReducer) export {store} Now in the App.js, you can use the store (without calling it): import {store} from 'path/to/store'; // rest of the codes ... <Provider store={store}> // rest of the codes ...\n",

      "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're importing and exporting your reducers, particularly when using `combineReducers`. Here's a concise explanation and solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Single Reducer Scenario**: If you only have one reducer, there's no need to use `combineReducers`. Instead, import and export your reducer directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   // foo.js\n",

      "     }\n",
      "   }\n",

      "   const store = createStore(myReducer);\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multiple Reducers Scenario**: If you have multiple reducers, you should still avoid using `combineReducers` directly in the main file. Instead, import each reducer separately and pass them to `createStore`:\n",

      "### QUESTION:\n",
      "What methods can be used to monitor native memory usage in the JVM?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In specific, how to understand the relationships connecting \"Runtime\", \"getRuntime()\" and \"totalMemory()\" Runtime is a class. getRuntime() is a static method of Runtime that returns a (actually THE ONLY) instance of Runtime. totalMemory() is an instance method of Runtime that returns the \"total memory\" used. For more details, read the javadoc (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html). Note that the definitions of the values returned by freeMemory, totalMemory and maxMemory are rather vague. Furthermore, the first two do not return the memory usage at the instant the method is called. Instead, they typically return a value calculated last time the GC ran. (One reason for the vaguely worded API specs is to avoid making these methods too costly, and/or too restrictive on the JVM implementation. It would be a BAD THING if the JVM couldn't use some fast GC technology because of a javadoc requirement to return accurate values for the memory usage at all times.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Depends on the JVM, perhaps the version...perhaps even how many paper clips you have on your desk at the time. It might not even work. Don't do that. If it's out of your control for some reason, compile and run this the same way you'd run your jar. But be warned, relying on the order of the options is a really bad idea. public class TotalMemory { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Total Memory: \"+Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory()); System.out.println(\"Free Memory: \"+Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()); } }\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the API (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html) totalMemory() Returns the total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine. The value returned by this method may vary over time, depending on the host environment. Note that the amount of memory required to hold an object of any given type may be implementation-dependent. maxMemory() Returns the maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use. If there is no inherent limit then the value Long.MAX_VALUE will be returned. freeMemory() Returns the amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine. Calling the gc method may result in increasing the value returned by freeMemory. In reference to your question, maxMemory() returns the -Xmx value. You may be wondering why there is a totalMemory() AND a maxMemory(). The answer is that the JVM allocates memory lazily. Lets say you start your Java process as such: java -Xms64m -Xmx1024m Foo Your process starts with 64mb of memory, and if and when it needs more (up to 1024m), it will allocate memory. totalMemory() corresponds to the amount of memory currently available to the JVM for Foo. If the JVM needs more memory, it will lazily allocate it up to the maximum memory. If you run with -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m, the value you get from totalMemory() and maxMemory() will be equal. Also, if you want to accurately calculate the amount of used memory, you do so with the following calculation : final long usedMem = totalMemory() - freeMemory();\n",
      "\n",
      "The currently allocated memory is the difference Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() Allocating an object, especially a large one, may require the JVM to obtain additional memory from the operating system. That is a relatively expensive operation, so it is more efficient for the JVM to request memory in large chunks. When it obtains more memory than the current allocation requires, both total memory and free memory will increase.\n",

For further memory analysis your best bet is any profiler tool like jvisualvm (https://visualvm.java.net/gettingstarted.html). Do remember it, that Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory(), this memory is total memory available to your JVM. java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m , it means that total memory of your program will start with 512MB, which may lazily loaded to max of 1024MB. So if you are running same program, on different JVMs, Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() might give you different results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javadoc indeed give a very clear definition. However it seems to me that OP is a bit confused on how JVM works. First, definition from Javadoc: freeMemory() : Returns the amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine. maxMemory() : Returns the maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use. totalMemory() : Returns the total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine. Explanation on how JVM allocate memory (this is of course a very brief explanation but it should give you the picture): In most, if not all, JVM implementation, there is usually a upper limit of memory that a JVM can request from OS. (e.g. in Sun/Oracle JVM, it is affected by -Xmx). If you set the limit to 2GB, then maxMemory() is going to return you 2GB. However, a JVM start, it is allowed to allocate less memory than its allowed upper limit. For example, even you have set the upper limit to 2GB, when the JVM start, it can request for only 500MB from OS. When there is more and more object created, and when it need more memory, it can then request more memory from the OS, until it hit the upper limit. In the above case, when JVM has allocated only 500MB from OS, totalMemory() is going to return 500MB. If within that 500MB, 400MB is already used (for objects created etc), then freeMemory() will return you 100MB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since a JVM executing a Java program is a Java process you don't have to worry about that. All threads share the same memory space in the JVM process. Hence it is sufficient to rely on Runtime.totalMemory() (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#totalMemory%28%29) Runtime.freeMemory() (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#freeMemory%28%29)\n",
      "\n",
      "What you are getting is the memory allocated by the JVM, not the actual memory usage. This is what I use to monitor actual memory usage: int mb = 1024 * 1024; String memory = \"Total Memory: \" + (Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() / mb) + \"MB\\nFree Memory: \" + (Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() / mb) + \"MB\\nUsed Memory: \" + ((Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()) / mb) + \"MB\"; You should see the used memory going up slowly and falling down whenever the garbage collector is called\n",
      "\n",
      "Toral memory is: The total allocated space reserved for the java process. See also this answer: What is runtime total memory ? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3571203/what-are-runtime-getruntime-totalmemory-and-freememory#18375641) However the Task manager reports the total memory that is consumed by the JVM in the machine. Task manager reports the memory that the OS (windows in this case) has allocated to the windows process running the JVM while Runtime.getTotalMemory() reports the total memory allocated to the current java Process running the thread that executes the method. For every thread Runtime is an instance that\" \"Every Java application has a single instance of class Runtime that allows the application to interface with the environment in which the application is running. The current runtime can be obtained from the getRuntime method.\" Runtime Javadoc (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Runtime.html) PS: If you run the programs in an IDE such as Eclipse you may notice big differences as the OS reports the total memory consumed by the IDE (Eclipse is a java program) plus the memory consumed by JVMs spawned to run java programs. Eclipse may start a different JVM instance to run a program. So running a Runtime in a spawned JVM that is used by eclipse reports the total memory inside it.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "To monitor native memory usage in the JVM, you can use several methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory()**: This method returns the total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine. It includes both heap memory and non-heap memory. Keep in mind that the value returned by this method may vary over time due to garbage collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()**: This method returns the amount of free memory in the Java virtual machine. As mentioned earlier, the value returned by this method may not reflect the exact free memory at the moment the method is called, as it depends on the garbage collector's schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()**: This method returns the maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use. If there is no inherent limit, it will return Long.MAX_VALUE.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Java 8 Native Memory Tracking (NMT)**: With the introduction of NMT in Java 8, you can monitor the native memory usage more accurately. To enable NMT, run your Java application with the option `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary`. At runtime, you can execute the following command to print JVM memory statistics: `jcmd <pid> VM.native_memory summary`. The output will provide detailed information about various memory segments, including reserved, committed, and allocated memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Profiling tools**: Utilize profiling tools such as jVisualVM or VisualVM to analyze memory usage, including both heap and non-heap memory. These tools offer visual representations of memory usage, allowing you to identify potential memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the values returned by Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() and Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() represent the memory allocated by the JVM, not the actual memory usage reported by the operating system. To compare JVM memory usage with OS memory usage, consider using external monitoring tools or APIs provided by the operating system.\n",

The recommended approach is to instead use Anaconda Navigator or the Anaconda Command Prompt (located in the Start Menu under “Anaconda”) when you wish to use Anaconda software. (Note: recent Win 10 does not assume you have privileges to install or update. If the command fails, right-click on the Anaconda Command Prompt, choose \"More\", chose \"Run as administrator\") This is a change from previous installations.

Before checking the box (https://i.stack.imgur.com/jYrxt.png) After checking the box (https://i.stack.imgur.com/RT1qJ.png) Finally I reinstalled the Anaconda without checking the check box ADD TO PATH then manually set the PATH. Better is to use your own custom location for Anaconda installation as I did. I do not know, in which system you are working. I am windows user and solved the issue as follows. Uninstalled the currently installed Anaconda. Created folder named C:\\AnacondaPython for reinstallation of Anaconda. Manually added the following 5 PATHS to PATH environment variable. C:\\AnacondaPython C:\\AnacondaPython\\Scripts C:\\AnacondaPython\\Library C:\\AnacondaPython\\Library\\mingw-w64\\bin C:\\AnacondaPython\\Library\\usr\\bin Or you can just append the below PATH series.

Your calculate_age function uses dob1 argument instead of this.state.dob1: calculate_age = (dob1) => { var today = new Date(); var birthDate = new Date(dob1); // create a date object directly from `dob1` argument var age_now = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear(); var m = today.getMonth() - birthDate.getMonth(); if (m < 0 || (m === 0 && today.getDate() < birthDate.getDate())) { age_now--; } console.log(age_now); return age_now; } Your handleChange_age now calls this.calculate_age with event.target.value: handleChange_age = (event) => { console.log(\"DOB:\", event.target.value); this.setState({ dob1: event.target.value }, () => { // example of setState callback // this will have the latest this.state.dob1 console.log(this.state.dob1); }) // call calculate_age with event.target.value var age_latest = {age_latest: this.calculate_age(event.target.value)} console.log(age_latest); this.setState({ age1: age_latest }, () => { // this will have the latest this.state.age1 console.log(\"Age:\", this.state.age1); }) }\n",

The URL for the sorry endpoint does not have a trailing slash. It’s similar to the pathname of a file. Accessing the URL with a trailing slash /sorry/ produces a 404 \"Not Found\" error. Alternatively, to make this works at the application level, You can use app.url_map.strict_slashes = False Setting strict_slashes to False will work as expected with the /sorry/ route.

If a rule does not end with a trailing slash and the user request the page with a trailing slash, a 404 not found is raised.

      "__proto__ (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) (which is not standard (but might be soon))) sets an object's prototype. .prototype (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_Revisited) sets the prototype of objects created by invoking the function it was set on as a constructor using new Also worth mentioning is Object.create (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) Here are examples: Pseudo-classical with .prototype: function Car(){ this.x = 15; } Car.prototype.y = 10; var g = new Car(); g.y; // this is 10; Using __proto__ (don't use this!): var g = {x:15}; g.__proto__ = {y:10}; g.y; // this is 10; This way is correct, and does not use constructors with new: var g = Object.create({y:10}); //creates x with prototype {y:10} g.x = 15; g.y; // this is 10 Here is an interesting tutorial on MDN covering these (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_Revisited).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried both approaches and I don't personally see any problem with the traditional approach using new. The main argument for Object.create is that it makes the prototypal inheritance more clear - you don't have to understand the intricacy of the prototype property on function constructors and how that relates to the actual prototype of the object. But it does require that initialization be a separate step. My preferred approach is to combine the two approaches, e.g.: function Animal(name) { this.name = name || null; } Animal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log('yum'); } function Cat(name) { Animal.call(this, name); } Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat; Cat.prototype.meow = function() { console.log('meow'); } var garfield = new Cat('garfield'); garfield.eat(); garfield.meow(); Object.create is better for inheritance here than Cat.prototype = new Animal() for two reasons: If you wanted to require the name parameter (throwing an exception if it wasn't passed), you could do so and the inheritance (Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)) would still work. If you forgot to call the Cat constructor from the Animal constructor, all of the properties that would have been created by the Animal constructor will be undefined instead, allowing you to quickly realize the mistake. Although this approach (using constructor functions and new) is less \"purely\" prototypal, it's still prototypal inheritance and as long as you understand how to use it correctly it works just fine, and requires a little less typing than the Object.create approach. I wrote some other notes about this in the documentation for my Javascript OO library, simpleoo (https://github.com/mbrowne/simpleoo.js). (Note: I may be changing the API soon for that library; I'm linking to it mainly because the documentation discusses some of these concepts in more detail.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, if you want to create an object, you can only use literals: var obj = {}; or the Object constructor. var obj = Object(); But none of these methods let you specify the prototype of the created object. This is what you can do with Object.create now. It lets you create a new object and sets the first argument as prototype of the new object. In addition, it allows you to set properties of the new object provided as second argument. It is similar to doing something like this (without the second argument): function create(proto) { var Constr = function(){}; Constr.prototype = proto; return new Constr(); } So if you are using a construct similar to this, this when you wanted to use Object.create. It is not a replacement for new. It is more an addition to make creating single objects which should inherit from another object simpler. Example: I have an object a: var a = { someFunction: function() {} }; and I want b to extend this object. Then you can use Object.create: b = Object.create(a); b.someOtherFunction = function(){}; Whenever you have a constructor function, but you only instantiate one object from it, you might be able to replace this with Object.create. There is general rule that applies. It depends very much on what the constructor function is doing and how you inherit from other objects, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a huge difference. Have a look at the docs! Object.create (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) does create an Object that inherits from the first argument, null in your case. In contrast, {} - or new Object() - creates a new object that inherits from Object.prototype. __proto__ (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) is non-standard and should not be used. However, in your case you just do Object.prototype.hello = function() {…};. Never extend that object with enumerable properties, never ever! Object.defineProperty (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) does define a property on an object with a special descriptor object. The enumerable, configurable and writable attributes default to false, which means that you wont be able to delete x.hello for example, or assign any other value. Your first snippet creates a plain object, which inherits a hello method from Object.prototype, while your second snippet creates an object inheriting from nothing and having a non-editable hello property. I don't see much relatedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "People use the prototype because it's an inheritance construct. If you want to inherit methods and properties from another object then you have to use the prototype. var Proto = { method: function () { } } var obj = function() { return Object.create(Proto); }\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see a difference between these 2 methods There is no difference in the outcome indeed (apart from minor details such as the enumerability of the .constructor property). So, why people/Guides don't use the second option? Because __proto__ is deprecated (https://stackoverflow.com/a/36061819/1048572), while Object.create (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) works about anywhere. It was standardised with ES5 and can easily be polyfilled for older environments. Since ES6, you could also use Object.setPrototypeOf (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf), but since ES6, you'd just write class Child extends Father { … }.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both ways are equally powerful. Some says that you are not a real JavaScript master if you do not embrace the pure prototypal approach, but really everything is still just prototypal inheritance and it's a matter of style. Personnaly, I prefer using a classical approach and make use of the new keyword together with a constructor function. Why? The classical model is very well-know. I don't have to implement an init function on my objects only to do what a constructor does already. As you probably noticed, the pure prototypal approach leaves you without a constructor so you will have to implement an initialization function (generally called init) if you need to run some initialization logic for newly created objects. However, I find that the pure prototypal approach is a bit less verbose and might be easier to understand for programmers without a strong background with languages implementing classical inheritance. By the way, one thing you should avoid with the classical model is to inherit using the new keyword like you are doing above because you are running the parent constructor logic unnecessary and it could potentially have undesirable side-effects. You should be using Object.create like below: function A(val) { this.val = val; } A.prototype.alertVal = function () { alert(this.val); }; function B(val) { A.call(this, val); //call parent constructor } B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype); //inherit from A var b = new B('test'); b.alertVal(); //test At the end, it's all a matter of taste and I respect both ways.

      "You're right, __proto__ is a non-standard property, and the only two standard ways you have to set a new object's [[Prototype]], are: Through the use of a constructor and the new operator (as you already mention). Using the ECMAScript 5 Object.create (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) method. Object.create is not widely supported (http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/) yet (works on IE9Pre3+, Firefox 3.7Alpha+, Chrome 5+ Safari 5+, Rhino 1.7), but at some point all the implementations will conform the ES5 spec. It can take two arguments, the first one is the object that will be used as the [[Prototype]] of the new object, and the second one, is another object where the own properties can be described (in the same structure that you would use Object.defineProperties (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties)). For example: var father = { firstProperty: 1, secondProperty: 2 }; var son = Object.create(father, { thirdProperty: { value: 'foo' } }); father.isPrototypeOf(son); // true son.firstProperty; // 1 The son internal [[Prototype]] property will refer to father, and it will contain a value property named thirdProperty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your first sample is the correct way to go about it, as it creates a new object with the parentObj.prototype as its [[Prototype]]: childObj.prototype = Object.create(parentObj.prototype); // { __proto__: parentObj.prototype } The second one just sets childObj.prototype to the same object as the parentObj.prototype. This causes some problems: function parentObj() { } parentObj.prototype.parentFn = function() { console.log('parent'); }; function childObj() { } childObj.prototype = parentObj.prototype; // here we are writing onto parentObj.prototype as well!!! childObj.prototype.childFn = function() { console.log('child'); }; var child = new childObj(); var parent = new childObj(); child.parentFn(); // 'parent' parent.childFn(); // 'child' --- this should not happen!!! In directly assigning the object, we have written onto the parent .prototype.\n",
      "\n",
      "For at least one good reason: the __proto__ feature is deprecated, so you shouldn't use it for future compatibility. I recommend reading MDN page on the topic (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto), and also linked pages on inheritance if you are learning. USEFUL ADDITIONAL NOTE: using b.prototype = Object.create(a.prototype); is a way to simulate Class inheritance in a prototype way (b inherits from a) without the \"parent\" (a) constructor to be called. If you would rather prefer to simulate inheritance with \"parent\" constructor being called, you can use b.prototype = new a(); Of course it's a emulation of class behavior, it differs in details because prototypes are not classes, for example you can dynamically add functions to a's prototype after an instance of b has been created, and the new function will be available for the instance because it works by reference. In a similar way the second example doesn't execute a's constructor for every further instance, but only once when you assign it to b's prototype. Actually I find prototypes really powerful when you get to know them, allows many combinations. function a () { console.log('a constructor'); } a.prototype.prtSomething = function(arg) { console.log(arg); } function b () { console.log('b constructor'); } b.prototype = Object.create(a.prototype); b.prototype.constructor = b; var myObj = new b(); function a () { console.log('a constructor'); } a.prototype.prtSomething = function(arg) { console.log(arg); } function b () { console.log('b constructor'); } b.prototype = new a(); b.prototype.constructor = b; var myObj = new b();\n",

      "Using `defaults()` offers several advantages over JavaScript prototyping, especially when working with complex object hierarchies or when dealing with third-party libraries that expect specific keys in their options objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Encapsulation**: `defaults()` helps encapsulate the default values within the function itself, making it easier to manage and maintain. With prototyping, default values must be defined elsewhere, such as in a separate configuration object or directly within the constructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Flexibility**: `defaults()` provides flexibility in defining default values based on input parameters. You can conditionally set defaults, which isn't straightforward with prototyping.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Code clarity**: `defaults()` clearly indicates the default values within the function definition, improving code readability and maintainability. Prototyping can lead to more scattered and less explicit code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ease of use**: When working with third-party libraries or APIs that expect specific keys in their options objects, `defaults()` simplifies the process of providing those keys with appropriate default values.\n",

But, IMHO option 2 is a better one for you in this case: chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab){ //... whatever other stuff you were doing anyway }); chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(function(evt){ chrome.tabs.get(evt.tabId, function(tab){ alert(tab.url); //the URL you asked for in *THIS QUESTION* }); }); Use only the onUpdated event once (better): Do both your other stuff and what you're looking for in your question in the same event: chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab){ //... whatever other stuff you were doing anyway chrome.tabs.getSelected(null, function(tab) { alert(tab.url); //the URL you asked for in *THIS QUESTION* }); }); .

It's safer to do so from create/update callbacks, i.e. chrome.tabs.update(tab.id, {url: \"http://www.EXAMPLE.COM\"}, function(tab){ chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, {file: \"content_script.js\"}); }); Note: you don't have to worry that the page did not finish loading at this point. executeScript obeys the run_at parameter (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#type-InjectDetails), which defaults to \"sometime after DOM is loaded\".\n",

And, you need to use typeof not .Type: if (typeof loop !== \"function\") throw \"Loop [0] is not a function.\"; Also, if items is just an array of strings as you have, then items[index].value doesn't make sense, since strings don't have a value property.

You mentioned that you're using a 3rd-party library so the part about typeof doesn't matter.

I tried out your code again, this time creating input elements with document.createElement: Array.prototype.make = function (loop, playground) { var loop = loop || function (value) { return value; }, playground = playground || this; if (typeof loop !== \"function\") throw \"Loop [0] is not a function.\"; var returned = []; for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) returned[i] = loop.apply(playground, [this[i], i, this]); return returned; }; var items = []; items.push(document.createElement(\"INPUT\")); items.push(document.createElement(\"INPUT\")); items.push(document.createElement(\"INPUT\")); var values = [4, 5, 6]; var returned = values.make(function (value, index) { return items[index].value = value; }); console.log(items[0].value, items[1].value, items[2].value); //firebug shows: 4 5 6 So it appears that your code is working by itself.

      "\n",
      "To refresh a graph within the same figure using Matplotlib, you can use the `draw()` method of the figure's canvas or the `draw_idle()` method provided by the figure instance. Here are two methods to achieve this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using `figure.canvas.draw()`:\n",
      "```python\n",

      "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",

      "    ax.plot([1, 2], [3, 4])  # Plot new data\n",
      "    fig.canvas.draw()  # Refresh the figure\n",
      "    sleep(1)  # Pause for a moment before updating again\n",
      "plt.show()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Using `fig.canvas.draw_idle()`:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "from time import sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
      "for i in range(10):\n",
      "    ax.clear()  # Clear the previous plot\n",
      "    ax.plot([1, 2], [3, 4])  # Plot new data\n",
      "    fig.canvas.draw_idle()  # Refresh the figure without blocking\n",
      "    sleep(1)  # Pause for a moment before updating again\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In both examples, we create a figure and axes object, then loop through a range of values to generate new plots. We clear the axes before plotting new data, ensuring that only the latest plot is displayed. After plotting, we either call `fig.canvas.draw()` or `fig.canvas.draw_idle()`, which refreshes the figure. The `sleep(1)` function is used to introduce a delay between updates, allowing you to observe the changes. Finally, we call `plt.show()` to display the figure when finished.\n",

It checks if an element is inside its parents and the viewport. Hopefully the comments are sufficient: // Return true if an element overlaps its parents and the viewport function isVisible(element) { return isInParents(element) && isInViewport(element); } // Return true if an element overlaps its parents function isInParents(el) { var rect = el.getBoundingClientRect(), rectP, visible = true; while (el && el.parentNode && el.parentNode.getBoundingClientRect && visible) { el = el.parentNode; rectP = el.getBoundingClientRect(); visible = rectInRect(rectP, rect); } return visible; } // Return true if element overlaps the viewport function isInViewport (element) { var rect = element.getBoundingClientRect(); return rectInRect({top:0, left:0, bottom: window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight, right: window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth }, rect); } // Return true if r1 overlaps r0 function rectInRect(r0, r1) { return r1.top < r0.bottom && r1.bottom > r0.top && r1.left < r0.right && r1.right > r0.left; } As to whether the element is visible or not depends on other factors, such as whether overlapping elements are hidden or not, or whether some other non–ancestor element is positioned on top, etc. Those conditions can be checked for but it becomes less and less efficient the more you have to check. If thoroughness and performance matter, create a binary tree index of the spatial location of all elements on the page and update it as you go. Creating the index is slow, but checking position will be hugely faster.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **File Permission Issues:**\n",
      "   - The primary challenge was related to file permissions. OFBiz, by default, uses Derby as its database, and the connection files are located within your project directory. If the code cannot establish a connection to the database, it might be due to insufficient file permissions. To resolve this issue, navigate to your OFBiz project directory and change the file permissions recursively using the command:\n",

      "     sudo chmod 777 -R your_project_name\n",

      "3. **Internal Server Error:**\n",
      "   - After running the OFBiz server, you encountered an internal error, which you've reported to the OFBiz team for potential patching.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **JDBC Driver Not Found:**\n",
      "   - An error message \"Cached loader got a known bad class name\" indicates that OFBiz couldn't locate the JDBC driver in the classpath. To address this issue, ensure that the appropriate JDBC driver jar is present in the following directory: `framework/entity/lib/jdbc/`\n",

Use state or props to determine if the redirect component needs to be shown (which then trigger's a redirect). import { Redirect } from 'react-router'; // ... your class implementation handleOnClick = () => { // some action... // then redirect this.setState({redirect: true}); } render() { if (this.state.redirect) { return <Redirect push to=\"/sample\" />; } return <button onClick={this.handleOnClick} type=\"button\">Button</button>; } Reference: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect (https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect) React Router v4 - Reference Router Context You can also take advantage of Router's context that's exposed to the React component. static contextTypes = { router: PropTypes.shape({ history: PropTypes.shape({ push: PropTypes.func.isRequired, replace: PropTypes.func.isRequired }).isRequired, staticContext: PropTypes.object }).isRequired }; handleOnClick = () => { this.context.router.push('/sample'); } This is how <Redirect /> works under the hood.

Below is a basic example but you can compose it to inject it with customizable props if needed. There are noted caveats with lifecycles, but it should always rerender the Router, just like in v2. This can be useful for redirects after an API request from an action function. // browser router file... import createHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory'; import { Router } from 'react-router'; export const history = createHistory(); export default class BrowserRouter extends Component { render() { return <Router history={history} children={this.props.children} /> } } // your main file... import BrowserRouter from './relative/path/to/BrowserRouter'; import { render } from 'react-dom'; render( <BrowserRouter> <App/> </BrowserRouter> ); // some file... where you don't have React instance references import { history } from './relative/path/to/BrowserRouter'; history.push('/sample'); Latest BrowserRouter to extend: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/modules/BrowserRouter.js (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/modules/BrowserRouter.js) React Router v2 Push a new state to the browserHistory instance: import {browserHistory} from 'react-router'; // ... browserHistory.push('/sample'); Reference: https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/NavigatingOutsideOfComponents.md (https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/NavigatingOutsideOfComponents.md)\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is the navigate function definition? This should be on the body of the component, using the useNavigate hook from React Router DOM... So your code should look like // on top of the file: import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // on your component: const navigate = useNavigate(); const listItem = [ { text:'Dashboard', onclick:()=>navigate(\"/dashboard\") }, { text:'Prdocut', onclick:()=>navigate(\"/product\") } ]; return ( <List> {listItem.map((item, index) => { const { text, onclick } = item; return ( <ListItem button key={text} onClick={onclick}> <ListItemText primary={text} /> </ListItem> )})} </List> ); As a more simple alternative, you may like to use Link component of React Router DOM, importing it like import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'; and using it like this on the jsx: const listItem = [ { text:'Dashboard', onclick: '/product' }, { text:'Product', onclick: '/product', } ]; return ( <List> {listItem.map((item, index) => { const { text, onclick } = item; return ( <Link key={text} to={onclick}> <ListItem button> <ListItemText primary={text} /> </ListItem> </Link> )})} </List> ); Anyways, the error is on the JSX (specifically, on the map function over listItem). In your code, you're destructuring an item like { text, onClick } but it should be NOT camelcase onClick, like this: { text, onclick }.\n",

      "I was not importing react-router-dom NavLink properly. I was importing NavLink, but from reactstrap. Fix (in NavBar component): import { NavLink as RouterNavLink } from \"react-router-dom\"; since both reactstrap and react-router-dom uses the same name (NavLink) and i wanted to use both due to design. I then wrapped the RouterNavLink within the NavLink like so: <NavLink> <RouterNavLink to=\"/start\">Start</RouterNavLink> </NavLink> It's not surprising that it did not work since i wsen't even importing correctly. Also, i did not need the static.json file.\n",

      "Issue You are using react-router-dom@6 and using the low-level Router when you should import and use one of the high-level routers (BrowserRouter, MemoryRouter, etc) and you are using the RRDv5 Route component APIs. The Router component has a couple required props to make it work. Router (https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/routers/router) declare function Router( props: RouterProps ): React.ReactElement | null; interface RouterProps { basename?: string; children?: React.ReactNode; location: Partial<Location> | string; navigationType?: NavigationType; navigator: Navigator; static?: boolean; } Missing from your code are the required navigator and location props which feed into an internal location context the low-level router holds. Solution Import a high-level router, wrap the Route components in the Routes component, and render the routed content on the element prop as a ReactNode, a.k.a. JSX. component (and render and children function props`) are v5 and don't exist in v6. The high-level routers maintain their own history/location contexts internally. Example: import './interface/App.css'; import { Home } from './interface/home'; import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'; function App() { return ( <div> <Router> <div> <Routes> <Route path='/' element={<Home />} /> </Routes> </div> </Router> </div> ); }\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the element you targeted is <NavLink> tag which normally should navigate to another router page, I believe the event you have attached will not get running. I suggest you to not using <NavLink> just use this.props.history.push('/path/to/route') instead on the onClick handler ( after the procedures you need to run before navigating to another routing address ). On the following example, Please pay attention about withRouter and i change <NavLink> to span then attach onHomeCLick handler to it: import React, {Component} from 'react'; import {withRouter, Route, BrowserRouter as Router} from \"react-router-dom\"; class YourComponent extends Component { onHomeCLick = () => { //DO something here prior to router navigation of \".home-link\" element this.props.history.push( '/' ); }; render(){ return ( <div> <Router> <div className=\"wrapper2\"> <nav id=\"menu-principal\" className=\"main menu-principal\"> <ul> <li><span className=\"home-link\" onClick={this.onHomeCLick}>início</span></li> <li><NavLink exact to=\"/nota_biografica\">nota biográfica</NavLink></li> </ul> </nav> <div className=\"page-content\"> <Route exact path='/nota_biografica' render={() => <NotaBiografica />} /> <Route exact path='/' render={() => <Home />} /> </div> </div> </Router> </div> ) } } export default withRouter( YourComponent ); UPDATE=========== Another trick if you like to use <NavLink>, the only solution is a \"Call back\" way. It will trigger once you navigated to the route ( I still can't see if there is way to do it prior to navigation ). Here we go: import React, {Component} from 'react'; import {Route, BrowserRouter as Router} from \"react-router-dom\"; class YourComponent extends Component { isActive= (match, location) => { if (match) { console.log('Hi i am active, do something here'); } return match; }; render(){ return ( <div> <Router> <div className=\"wrapper2\"> <nav id=\"menu-principal\" className=\"main menu-principal\"> <ul> <li><NavLink className=\"home-link\" activeClassName=\"active\" isActive={this.isActive}>início</NavLink></li> <li><NavLink exact to=\"/nota_biografica\">nota biográfica</NavLink></li> </ul> </nav> <div className=\"page-content\"> <Route exact path='/nota_biografica' render={() => <NotaBiografica />} /> <Route exact path='/' render={() => <Home />} /> </div> </div> </Router> </div> ) } } export default YourComponent;\n",

      "JPA: Querying through an Interface Rather Than Its Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means is that you cannot map (annotate) or query on an inferface. You can only query @Entity classes, and these can only be placed on real classes, not interfaces. Normally this is not an issue, an interface has no state, so is not something that is really relevant to persistence most of the time. You can still use interfaces in your model, you just can't map them directly. If you have a relationship that uses an interface type, you just need to set the targetEntity to the implementation class. If you have multiple implementers and can't make them share inheritance then you need to get more creative. Some JPA providers such as EclipseLink have support for interfaces. See, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Advanced_Topics#Interfaces (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Advanced_Topics#Interfaces)\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "In Java Persistence API (JPA), entities must be mapped to concrete classes, not interfaces. This is because JPA needs to know the actual table structure and column names to generate SQL queries. Interfaces lack this information since they don't have any attributes or methods that correspond to database columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, you can still use interfaces in your domain model. The key is to ensure that each implementing class is properly annotated with `@Entity` and has its own `@Table` annotation specifying the corresponding table name. For relationships involving interfaces, you should use the `targetEntity` attribute in your annotations to reference the implementing class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "// Define the interface\n",

      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `Owner` entity has a collection of `Animal` objects, which are actually instances of `Dog` or `Cat`. The `Map` is used to store the mapping between the owner and their pets.

Here the only complication is that you need to determine the relationship between previous and subsequent group labels, in case there isn't some simple + 1 increment between labels of susbequent groups. # Cumcount within group s = df.groupby(['col_1', 'col_2']).cumcount() # Determine how many cumcounts were within all previous groups of `col_1' to_merge = s.add(1).groupby(df['col_1']).max().cumsum().add(1).to_frame('new') # Link group with prior group label df1 = df[['col_1']].drop_duplicates() df1['col_1_shift'] = df1['col_1'].shift(-1) df1 = pd.concat([to_merge, df1.set_index('col_1')], axis=1) # Bring the group offset over df = df.merge(df1, left_on='col_1', right_on='col_1_shift', how='left') # Add the group offset to the cumulative count within group. # First group (no previous group) is NaN so fill with 1. df['new'] = df['new'].fillna(1, downcast='infer') + s # Clean up merging column df = df.drop(columns='col_1_shift') col_1 col_2 col_3 new 0 1 A 1 1 1 1 B 1 1 2 2 A 3 2 3 2 A 3 3 4 2 A 3 4 5 2 B 3 2 6 2 B 3 3 7 2 B 3 4 8 3 A 2 5 9 3 A 2 6 10 3 C 2 5 11 3 C 2 6\n",

Have you tried running your application with a parameter like: -Dlog4j.configuration=file:config/log4j.properties So that Log4j finds your configuration file (\"config/log4j.properties\" using System Property log4j.configuration): Alternatively, you can also put this configuration file in your classpath so that Log4j finds it, like in your source directory for example: Else, here is what Log4j documentation explains or this error message: This occurs when the default configuration files log4j.properties and log4j.xml can not be found and the application performs no explicit configuration. log4j uses Thread.getContextClassLoader().getResource() to locate the default configuration files and does not directly check the file system. Knowing the appropriate location to place log4j.properties or log4j.xml requires understanding the search strategy of the class loader in use. log4j does not provide a default configuration since output to the console or to the file system may be prohibited in some environments. Also see FAQ: Why can't log4j find my properties in a J2EE or WAR application?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is you log4j.properties on the classpath at all? It needs to appear somewhere on the classpath (ideally in the root). You can run java -cp lib/*:. -Dlog4j.debug Test.main to see which configuration file log4j is loading. If it isn't your log4j.properties, you might need to move yours to make log4j pick it up. Another option is to just use java -cp lib/*:. -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties Test.main (note I've only ever used this with log4j.xml, so I can't guarantee it will work with log4j.properties).\n",

      "The log4j documentation (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html) states The exact default initialization algorithm is defined as follows: Setting the log4j.defaultInitOverride system property to any other value then \"false\" will cause log4j to skip the default initialization procedure (this procedure). Set the resource string variable to the value of the log4j.configuration system property. The preferred way to specify the default initialization file is through the log4j.configuration system property. In case the system property log4j.configuration is not defined, then set the string variable resource to its default value \"log4j.properties\". Attempt to convert the resource variable to a URL. If the resource variable cannot be converted to a URL, for example due to a MalformedURLException, then search for the resource from the classpath by calling org.apache.log4j.helpers.Loader.getResource(resource, Logger.class) which returns a URL. Note that the string \"log4j.properties\" constitutes a malformed URL. If no URL could not be found, abort default initialization. Otherwise, configure log4j from the URL. Since you haven't specified such a property, log4j will look for a log4j.properties at the root of the classpath. Your properties file is with config and so log4j can't find it. Either move it or provide a system property with its location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe you are importing any library with a custom log4.properties file, or your properties file is not visible on the classpath See here for a discussion on how to setup https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html#defaultInit (https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html#defaultInit) You could try to set the log4j.configuration property when starting your class. -Dlog4j.configuration=\"PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE\" And see if this is now picked up\n",

You mentioned that your Log4J configuration file is inside a package called resources, which is exactly why it can't find it. You have the following options: Move the log4j.properties file so it's located in the default package. Create a folder in your project (not a package), place your log4j.properties file there and add that folder to your runtime classpath.

      "To resolve the missing `log4j.properties` file issue, you need to ensure that the file is accessible via the classpath. Here are several methods to achieve this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Move the log4j.properties file to the root directory**: Place the `log4j.properties` file directly in the root directory of your project, ensuring it's alongside your `src` folder. Then, run your application with the `-Dlog4j.configuration=file:./log4j.properties` JVM argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add the directory containing log4j.properties to the classpath**: If you prefer keeping your `log4j.properties` file in a subdirectory, such as `config`, add the parent directory of that subdirectory to your classpath. For instance, if `config` is in the root directory, include it in your classpath with `-Dlog4j.configuration=file:./config/log4j.properties`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use a relative classpath entry**: Add the directory containing your `log4j.properties` file as a relative classpath entry in your build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) or IDE settings. For example, in Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```xml\n",
      "   <build>\n",
      "     <resources>\n",
      "       <resource>\n",
      "         <directory>src/main/resources</directory>\n",

      "     </resources>\n",
      "   </build>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Set the log4j.configuration system property**: As mentioned before, you can explicitly tell Log4J where to find the configuration file by setting the `-Dlog4j.configuration` system property when running your application. This approach works even if your `log4j.properties` file is nested within directories:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```sh\n",
      "   java -cp target/classes:lib/* -Dlog4j.configuration=file:./config/log4j.properties YourMainClass\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use the ClassLoader to load the configuration file**: Instead of relying on the default initialization process, manually load the configuration file using the `ClassLoader`. Modify your code to include the following snippet:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   ClassLoader classLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();\n",
      "   PropertyConfigurator.configure(classLoader.getResource(\"log4j.properties\"));\n",

      "Struggling to access data from another controller through a shared service mechanism?\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "shared service is a better option for simple data sharing between controllers. using controller's inheritance ties your logic with the view, which makes your code less flexible and error prone: you can't use one controller on the page without the other (ties the parent to children). you have to ensure that controllers are declared in the correct order. mid-parent controllers may shadow top parent variables. you may also consider using an event model(with $rootscope), if you have to notify many controllers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of your business logic should reside in a \"service/factory.\" Your controller should then just be a thin layer to call into the \"services\" Both controllers can then just inject in the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the \"angular way\". Shared data should be placed into services, then injected where needed. I like to think of my Angular apps mainly in terms of models (which are usually stored in services) and views. The controllers are just the glue that allows us to project/extract the parts of our models that a particular UI view needs. Also, think of services as returning a model API, not a model object (to quote Josh (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16607874/where-should-model-state-be-stored-in-angular-js#comment23896198_16607874)).\n",
      "\n",
      "To share the data among independent controllers, Services can be used. Create a service with the data model that needs to be shared. Inject the service in the respective controllers. In the following example, Service is used to store the variable x. The independent controllers will check the value of X whenever needed. angular.module('myApp', []) .service('myService', function () { var x=5 ; return { increase : function() { x++; }, getX : function() { return x; } }; }) function ControllerA($scope, myService) { $scope.x = 1; $scope.incrementDataInService= function() { myService.increase(); } $scope.syncDataWithService= function() { $scope.x = myService.getX(); } } function ControllerB($scope, myService) { $scope.x = 1; $scope.incrementDataInService= function() { myService.increase(); } $scope.syncDataWithService= function() { $scope.x = myService.getX(); } }​\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use services to share data between controllers. Keep global variables to the absolute minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common way seems to be initialise your objects in a single module have all other modules import the same object from that module eg define repositories.py customer_repository = CustomerRepository(options) ... and in service.py from repositories import customer_repository customer_repository.find(id==5) In general imports are cached (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-module-cache), so all the modules should import the same instance of the object. Regardless, since you're doing DDD, those objects should probably be stateless anyway. You should never do this for shared data that will change, as global data is not thread safe in web applications (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32815451/are-global-variables-thread-safe-in-flask-how-do-i-share-data-between-requests). If you want to share data between requests, use a database or other external data store.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used this approach with great success. The beauty of this solution was that each controller could encapsulate its own logic while also relying on common functionality I wanted to make available to all of my controllers. I made my base controller abstract and implement Initializable and overrode the method in the subclass controller. Field injection was also handled on a subclass level.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're on the right track, use can use a factory or a service to share code between controllers. Note that in angular services(and factories) are singletons; they are instantiated once when the app starts and then anytime you inject it into a controller, you are referencing the same instance. Consider the following code: var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]); myApp.service('MyService', function() { let _someValue = 'Initial Value'; this.setValue = function(value){ _someValue = value; } this.getValue = function(){ return _someValue; } }); //First Controller Run myApp.controller('ControllerA', function($scope, MyService) { MyService.getValue(); //Initial Value MyService.setValue(\"BRAND NEW VALUE!!!\"); }); //Run after ControllerA myApp.controller('ControllerB', function($scope, MyService) { MyService.getValue(); //BRAND NEW VALUE!!! }); Her you'll see that MyService holds the state of someValue. ControllerA get MyService injected to it and can use the methods of that service to set a new value. Now for any subsequent call for that same state, like for instance by ControllerB, the updated value will be returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should be using a service to encapsulate the service calls and maintain the data that you want to be persistent between various controllers. Your controllers will generally end up being much simpler this way see an example I wrote up here Angular $http vs service vs ngResource (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17667455/angular-http-vs-service-vs-ngresource/17668516#17668516)\n",

      "Unsure of whether this (https://stackoverflow.com/q/1198016/8824174) would help. Its in Java and you have asked about python but similar principles would apply. Also have a look at some design patterns (https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) which would give you more information on what you would require. Have you considered the following points? If you are going for only two users in a conversation you could create a central controller for the conversation which would provide the interface for interaction between the users. Another way to handle this might be through a mediator. class MessageController(): MsgList=[] def getMsgs(): return MsgList def publishMsg(msg): MsgList.append(msg) In such a case, you could go ahead and also create a message interface and a user interface and the controller would have a list/collection of messages which could be accessed by the users. The previous point would also enable you to create a conversation with more users. Though I understand that the controller is becoming a god object at this point. Also if you wish for some kind of access control you could start giving \"Roles\" to the users. More info on that if you wish in the decorator section of the design pattern link. Also as Gourang has stated you could use observers to reduce the functions of the central controller so as to reduce the amount of responsibility given to that class. As you can see there is possibly no \"correct\" way for this. I am relatively new to Software dev and learning myself, so please feel free to give any inputs you would like regarding the same.\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "To share data between controllers in AngularJS, you can use a shared service. Here's how you can do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a Service:** Define a service that will hold the shared data. This service should be a singleton, meaning it will be instantiated only once throughout the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);\n",
      "\n",
      "myApp.service('myService', function () {\n",
      "    var x = 5;\n",
      "\n",
      "    this.increase = function () {\n",
      "        x++;\n",
      "    };\n",
      "\n",
      "    this.getX = function () {\n",
      "        return x;\n",
      "    };\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inject the Service in Controllers:** Inject the service into the controllers where you need to access or modify the shared data.\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "myApp.controller('ControllerA', ['$scope','myService', function ($scope, myService) {\n",
      "    $scope.x = 1;\n",
      "\n",
      "    $scope.incrementDataInService = function () {\n",
      "        myService.increase();\n",
      "    };\n",
      "\n",
      "    $scope.syncDataWithService = function () {\n",
      "        $scope.x = myService.getX();\n",
      "    };\n",
      "}]);\n",
      "\n",
      "myApp.controller('ControllerB', ['$scope','myService', function ($scope, myService) {\n",
      "    $scope.x = 1;\n",
      "\n",
      "    $scope.incrementDataInService = function () {\n",
      "        myService.increase();\n",
      "    };\n",
      "\n",
      "    $scope.syncDataWithService = function () {\n",
      "        $scope.x = myService.getX();\n",
      "    };\n",
      "}]);\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In `ControllerA` and `ControllerB`, you can now call methods on `myService` to increment or retrieve the shared value `x`. This way, both controllers can access and update the same data, ensuring consistency across different views.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, services are meant to encapsulate business logic and provide a clean separation between your controllers and views. By using services, you can keep your controllers lean and focused on handling user interactions and updating the view.\n",

      "The exception you are getting comes from the JSON decoder during the response.json() call. This means the response you are getting is not a valid JSON string, which could have happened for multiple reasons. Most likely, the response have had a non-successful status code (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-status-codes), and didn't contain any payload. The /url/report endpoint expects that the resource parameter is either an id of a previously performed scan, or a valid URL, otherwise the API responds with a status code 400. This would be easy to fix by ignoring unsuccessful or empty responses: url = 'https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/url/report' params = {'apikey': api, 'resource':var} response = requests.get(url, params=params) if response.status_code != requests.codes.ok: return if not response.text: return x = response.text.find(\"true\") Making sense of error codes The code above might not be the ideal solution, as unsuccessful response could also mean that your API key has expired or wasn't provided (response.status_code == 403), or the request itself was malformed (response.status_code == 400). This would effectively allow malicious links through, as every error request will be ignored. To account for that, I'd suggest to raise an error for all non-2xx status codes. This can be done by calling response.raise_for_status() (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/#requests.Response.raise_for_status). Alternatively, you could return early if response.status_code == 400, and raise for the rest of errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have a schema (http/https) on your URL, which is also not a complete URL: import requests api_key = \"myapiKEY123\" client_id = 'xxx123' url = f'https://api.myapi.io/v2/apps/mine/{client_id}/data/ticket/search' headers = { 'x-api-key': api_key, 'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-type': 'application/json', } data = { 'startDate': '2021-03-01', 'endDate': '2021-04-12', } response = requests.get(url, data=data, headers=headers, timeout=10) response.raise_for_status() Then either print the response as JSON (if they're responding with JSON, which is probable) like response.json() or as text response.text. The response.raise_for_status() will check if the status code indicated a failure (e.g. the response code was a 400-599 (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/_modules/requests/models/#Response.raise_for_status)) and raise an exception with the status code and the error. You're also not passing the API key in the format the curl is suggesting, which I fixed above. I also added a timeout, because note that the requests library does not have a timeout by default, so if the server misbehaves the connection will block forever which is not good. I also doubt you're supposed to be passing the start and end date as query parameters rather than as data in the body of the request, so I've made that update as well. Using params would result in a request that looked like this: https://api.myapi.io/v2/apps/mine/{client_ID}/data/ticket/search?startDate=2021-03-01&endDate=2021-04-12 When what the curl (and my above example) is doing is passing those values as JSON in the POST request body. requests.get() is going to return a requests.Response object, so it's also a bit nonsensical to assign it to a variable called requestObject. Review the following docs: Post Requests (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests) Passing parameters in URLS (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls) Custom Headers (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#custom-headers) Timeouts (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#timeouts) Errors and Exceptions (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#errors-and-exceptions) It's not a functional problem in your code, but by convention (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names), function and variable names should be lowercase in Python and use underscores to separate terms, not camel case. E.g. response_object rather than responseObject, api_key rather than API_KEY, and client_id rather than client_ID. Again, it doesn't make your code not work, it's just convention. You can ignore it, but I wanted to point it out at least.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "Navigating between different web browsers with Linktext in Selenium involves understanding how to manage multiple windows or tabs within a single browser session. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Open a new tab**: You can open a new tab using the `execute_script` method along with JavaScript commands. For instance, `driver.execute_script(\"window.open('your_link', '_blank');\")`. This command opens a new tab with the specified URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Switch to the new tab**: After opening a new tab, you need to switch to it. You can obtain a list of all window handles using `driver.window_handles`. The current window handle is accessible via `driver.current_window_handle`. To switch to the new tab, use `driver.switch_to.window(window_handle)`, where `window_handle` is the identifier of the new tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Interact with elements**: Once you're in the new tab, you can interact with elements using various locators such as XPath, CSS selector, etc. For instance, to find an element by its text content (`linktext`), use `driver.find_element_by_link_text('desired_link_text')`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Wait for elements**: To ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them, use `WebDriverWait` along with appropriate expected conditions. For example, `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//input[@class=\"form-control ltr_override input ext-input text-box ext-text-box\"]')))` waits up to 10 seconds for the element to become clickable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Close unnecessary tabs**: If you have multiple tabs and want to close specific ones, you can use `driver.close()` to close the current tab. Be cautious while closing tabs, as this might disrupt the automation flow if not handled properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a complete example demonstrating these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from selenium import webdriver\n",

      "\n",
      "You don't need to use replace() in this case, since you are already checking that text[i] is equal to oldString, which means you are replacing the entire String, which means assignment is sufficient: for (int i = 0; i < text.length; i++) { if (text[i].equals(oldString)) { text[i] = newString; } } If, on the other hand, you wanted to replace a sub-string of text[i] which is equal to oldString to newString, you could write: for (int i = 0; i < text.length; i++) { text[i] = text[i].replace(oldString,newString); }\n",
      "\n",
      "updatedstring = rawstring.replace(word, x); This keeps replacing your updatedstring with the rawstring with a the single replacement. You need to do something like updatedstring = rawstring; ... updatedString = updatedString.replace(word, x); Edit: That is the solution to the problem you are seeing but there are a few other problems with your code: Your replacement won't work for things that you needed to lowercased or remove characters from. You create the words array that you iterate from altered version of your rawstring. Then you go back and try to replace the altered versions from your original rawstring where they don't exist. This will not find the words you think you are replacing. If you are doing global replacements, you could just create a set of words instead of an array since once the word is replaced, it shouldn't come up again. You might want to be replacing the words one at a time, because your global replacement could cause weird bugs where a word in the replacement map is a sub word of another replacement word. Instead of using String.replace, make an array/list of words, iterate the words and replace the element in the list if needed and join them. In java 8: String.join(\" \", elements);\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the stack trace and read the line number where the NullPointerException is thrown. Almost always, the line has some method invocation like x.getValue() If x is null, you get a NullPointerException. If the method at the top of the stack trace is not your code, trace the stack all the way back until you do reach your code. Very often in this case, you are passing null to a method that doesn't like null parameters. Find it and fix it. Also, very often when you encounter a method that is not yours that is throwing a NullPointerException, read the documentation. For example, look at String.replace(CharSequence target, CharSequence replacement) (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replace(java.lang.CharSequence,%20java.lang.CharSequence)): Throws: NullPointerException - if target or replacement is null. It doesn't get much clearer than that! Here's an example: Looking at line 4, we see foo.bar(). This implies that foo is null. That one is easy. Let's look at another example: Tracing back to your code, we see that s.replace(target, replacement) is throwing. We should inspect target and replacement. Let's attach a debugger: Aha! replacement is null. You can do the same thing in Eclipse. Set a breakpoint for when an exception is thrown, and use it to inspect the parameters to your method. I'm primitive here because I come from a school of thought where I genuinely believe everyone would be better off if they learned to do it the hard way first. Leaky abstractions and all that.\n",

      "I changed your code a little bit: import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStreamReader; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { String sentence = \"\"; int wordLenght = 0; String myWord = \"\"; InputStreamReader is = new InputStreamReader(System.in); BufferedReader bis = new BufferedReader(is); try { System.out.println(\"Text input: \"); sentence = bis.readLine(); System.out.println(\"Word lenth to replace\"); wordLenght = Integer.parseInt(bis.readLine()); System.out.println(\"Word to replace to\"); myWord = bis.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } Text myText = new Text(myWord, sentence, wordLenght); System.out.println(myText.getChangeSentence()); } } class Text { private String mySentence; private int charNumber; private String wordToChange; private String newSentence = \"1.\"; public Text(String wordToChange, String mySentece, int charNumber) { this.mySentence = mySentece; this.wordToChange = wordToChange; this.charNumber = charNumber; } public String getChangeSentence() { String[] words = mySentence.split(\" \"); for(int i = 0 ; i < words.length ; i++) { if(words[i].length() == charNumber) { words[i] = wordToChange; } } for (String word : words) { newSentence += word + \" \"; } return newSentence; } } Input : This is a test word length : 2 word to replace : ii output: This ii a test\n",

      "First, you are not storing your Replaced String anywhere. It is gone with the wind. Second, your replace will not modify the existing list. You would need to set the new string into the existing location, since you are using traditional for-loop. Or, you can have a new list, and add modified values to that list. Remember, since String in Java is immutable, so all the methods of String class return a new string. They do not modify the existing one. So, you need to re-assign the returned String into a new one. Try out this code: - public void readAndReplace() { // You can also create a new list out of the existing list. // That way, you won't need to modify the existing one. List<String> newList = new ArrayList<String>(); for(int i = 0; i < someList .size(); i++) { if(someList.get(i).contains(someString)) { newList.add(someList.get(i).replace(someString, otherString)); //someList.set(i, someList.get(i).replace(someString, otherString)); } else { // If it not contains `someString`, add it as it is to newList newList.add(someList.get(i)); } } System.out.println(someList); // Original System.out.println(newList); // New List }\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not accumulating replacements, but instead assign just the last replacement to newText. Instead of using newText, just assign the new string to the text variable. for (String word : words) { text = text.replaceAll(word, \"***\"); } System.out.println(text); Also, as noted in a comment, be aware that replaceAll (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replaceAll%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29) actually expects a regular expression, so this might fail, if the strings to be replaced contain any regular expression control characters. Instead, you should just use replace (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replace%28java.lang.CharSequence,%20java.lang.CharSequence%29), which will also replace all the matching substrings. And if you want the number of * to match the length of the word, you can use this technique (https://stackoverflow.com/a/4903603/1639625): for (String word : words) { String xxx = new String(new char[word.length()]).replace(\"\\0\", \"*\"); text = text.replace(word, xxx); } System.out.println(text); Output: ********* announced its next generation **** compiler today. It uses advanced parser and special optimizer for the ********* ***. Speaking of regular expressions, you could in fact also use replaceAll with a regular expression covering all your forbidden words, by replacing the , with a | (provided that those words contain no regex control characters). String forbiddenWords = \"Java,JVM,Microsoft\"; text = text.replaceAll(forbiddenWords.replace(',', '|'), \"***\");\n",

      "Programmers often do this: String sentence = \"Hello Java World!\"; sentence.replace(\"Java\", \"\"); System.out.println(sentence); => Hello Java World Strings are immutable, and the replace function returns a new string object. So instead write String sentence = \"Hello Java World!\"; sentence = sentence.replace(\"Java\", \"\"); System.out.println(sentence); => Hello World! (the whitespace still exists) With that, your replace function could look like public String remove(String phrase, String[] words) { String result = phrase; for (String word: words) { result = result.replace(word, \"\").replace(\" \", \" \"); } return result.trim(); }\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as @D George has said, you need to loop through with a loop and use the .equals() method to compare strings. You can modify your code to look like this... or use the .replaceFirst() method of the string object to replace the first occurrence of the search string. Try this public static String[] changeWords(String text, String find, String replace) { String[] words = new String[0]; words = text.split(\" \"); for(int i = 0; i < words.length; i++){ if (words[i].equalsIgnoreCase(find)) { words[i]=replace; break; } } return words; } OR THIS public static String[] changeWords(String text, String find, String replace) { return text.replaceFirst(find, replace); } The approach above is well suited in a situation where you want to replace only the first occurrence of the search string. if you want to replace all the occurences of the search string, you do not need to use an array as the string object comes with a replace method. you can do this to replace all occurrences: public static String[] changeWords(String text, String find, String replace) { return text.replace(find, replace); }\n",

The general idea is to set some pseudo states to the Spinner when the min/max values are reached. And style the arrow buttons based on the pseudo states. Below is the sample demo of the above approach. (https://i.stack.imgur.com/EMPJU.gif) import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.css.PseudoClass; import javafx.geometry.Insets; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.control.Spinner; import javafx.scene.control.SpinnerValueFactory; import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane; import javafx.stage.Stage; public class SpinnerDemo extends Application { @Override public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception { PseudoClass minPseudo = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass(\"minvalue\"); PseudoClass maxPseudo = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass(\"maxvalue\"); Spinner<Integer> spinner = new Spinner<>(); spinner.getStyleClass().add(Spinner.STYLE_CLASS_SPLIT_ARROWS_VERTICAL); SpinnerValueFactory.IntegerSpinnerValueFactory valueFactory = new SpinnerValueFactory.IntegerSpinnerValueFactory(2, 5); spinner.valueProperty().addListener((obs, old, val) -> { spinner.pseudoClassStateChanged(minPseudo, val == valueFactory.getMin()); spinner.pseudoClassStateChanged(maxPseudo, val == valueFactory.getMax()); }); spinner.setValueFactory(valueFactory); StackPane root = new StackPane(spinner); root.setPadding(new Insets(15)); Scene sc = new Scene(root, 250, 200); sc.getStylesheets().add(getClass().getResource(\"spinner.css\").toString()); stage.setScene(sc); stage.setTitle(\"Spinner\"); stage.show(); } } CSS code: .spinner:maxvalue .increment-arrow-button { -fx-background-color: -fx-outer-border, #999999; } .spinner:minvalue .decrement-arrow-button { -fx-background-color: -fx-outer-border, #999999; } There may be other ways as well.

      "To ensure a JavaScript function executes only once, regardless of how many times it's called, you can implement either a debounce or throttle pattern. These patterns help manage the frequency of function execution based on the number of calls or the time elapsed since the last call.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Debounce:\n",
      "\n",
      "A debounce function ensures that your function runs only once after a specified delay following the last call. This means that if the function is invoked repeatedly within the delay period, it will not execute until the delay has passed without further invocations. Here's an implementation using Underscore.js:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "var debouncedFunction = _.debounce(function() {\n",
      "  // Do something here\n",
      "}, 250);\n",
      "\n",
      "// Call debouncedFunction as needed\n",
      "debouncedFunction();\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the function inside `_.debounce()` will be executed after 250 milliseconds of inactivity. If `debouncedFunction` is called again before the 250ms delay, the timer resets, and the function won't execute until the next 250ms period.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Throttle:\n",
      "\n",
      "A throttle function limits the execution of your function to a maximum rate, ensuring it runs no more than once per interval. This is useful when you want to maintain a consistent rate of execution, such as updating a UI every few hundred milliseconds. Here's an implementation using Underscore.js:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "var throttledFunction = _.throttle(function() {\n",
      "  // Do something here\n",
      "}, 500);\n",
      "\n",
      "// Call throttledFunction as needed\n",
      "throttledFunction();\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "With this implementation, `throttledFunction` will run once every 500 milliseconds, regardless of how often it is called during that period. Once the 500ms interval has passed with no further calls, the function will execute again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both debounce and throttle functions can be implemented manually without relying on external libraries. However, using established libraries like Underscore.js simplifies the process and provides well-tested implementations.\n",

      "I don't have enough memory to hold a 50000x50000 dense matrix in memory and multiply it by a 50000 vector. But find here some tests with lower dimensionality.

Matrices: N = 5000 # Sparse matrices A = make_csr(10*10, N) # ~100 non-zero B = make_csr(100*100, N) # ~10000 non-zero C = make_csr(1000*1000, N) # ~1000000 non-zero D = make_csr(5000*5000, N) # ~25000000 non-zero E = csr_matrix(np.random.randn(N,N), dtype=np.float32) # non-sparse # Numpy dense arrays An = A.todense() Bn = B.todense() Cn = C.todense() Dn = D.todense() En = E.todense() b = np.random.randn(N) Timings: >>> %timeit A.dot(b) # 9.63 µs per loop >>> %timeit An.dot(b) # 41.6 ms per loop >>> %timeit B.dot(b) # 41.3 µs per loop >>> %timeit Bn.dot(b) # 41.2 ms per loop >>> %timeit C.dot(b) # 3.2 ms per loop >>> %timeit Cn.dot(b) # 41.2 ms per loop >>> %timeit D.dot(b) # 35.4 ms per loop >>> %timeit Dn.dot(b) # 43.2 ms per loop >>> %timeit E.dot(b) # 55.5 ms per loop >>> %timeit En.dot(b) # 43.4 ms per loop For highly sparse matrices (A and B) it is more than 1000x times faster. For not very sparse matrices (C), it still gets 10x speedup. For almost non-sparse matrix (D will have some 0 due to repetition in the indices, but not many probabilistically speaking), it is still faster, not much, but faster. For a truly non-sparse matrix (E), the operation is slower, but not much slower. Conclusion: the speedup you get depends on the sparsity of your matrix, but with N = 5000 sparse matrices are always faster (as long as they have some zero entries). I can't try it for N = 50000 due to memory issues. You can try the above code and see what is like for you with that N.\n",

      "The sparse matrix multiplication routines are directly coded in C++, and as far as a quick look at the source reveals, there doesn't seem to be any hook to any optimized library. Furthermore, it doesn't seem to be taking advantage of the fact that the second matrix is a vector to minimize calculations. So you can probably speed things up quite a bit by accessing the guts of the sparse matrix, and customizing the multiplication algorithm. The following code does so in pure Python/Numpy, and if the vector really has \"a few non-null points\" it matches the speed of scipy's C++ code: if you implemented it in Cython, the speed increase should be noticeable: def sparse_col_vec_dot(csc_mat, csc_vec): # row numbers of vector non-zero entries v_rows = csc_vec.indices v_data = csc_vec.data # matrix description arrays m_dat = csc_mat.data m_ind = csc_mat.indices m_ptr = csc_mat.indptr # output arrays sizes = m_ptr.take(v_rows+1) - m_ptr.take(v_rows) sizes = np.concatenate(([0], np.cumsum(sizes))) data = np.empty((sizes[-1],), dtype=csc_mat.dtype) indices = np.empty((sizes[-1],), dtype=np.intp) indptr = np.zeros((2,), dtype=np.intp) for j in range(len(sizes)-1): slice_ = slice(*m_ptr[[v_rows[j] ,v_rows[j]+1]]) np.multiply(m_dat[slice_], v_data[j], out=data[sizes[j]:sizes[j+1]]) indices[sizes[j]:sizes[j+1]] = m_ind[slice_] indptr[-1] = len(data) ret = sps.csc_matrix((data, indices, indptr), shape=csc_vec.shape) ret.sum_duplicates() return ret A quick explanation of what is going on: a CSC matrix is defined in three linear arrays: data contains the non-zero entries, stored in column major order. indices contains the rows of the non-zero entries. indptr has one entry more than the number of columns of the matrix, and items in column j are found in data[indptr[j]:indptr[j+1]] and are in rows indices[indptr[j]:indptr[j+1]]. So to multiply by a sparse column vector, you can iterate over data and indices of the column vector, and for each (d, r) pair, extract the corresponding column of the matrix and multiply it by d, i.e. data[indptr[r]:indptr[r+1]] * d and indices[indptr[r]:indptr[r+1]].\n",

Depending on what BLAS library your installation is linked to, such a call can be far more efficient than the straightforward C implementation used for matrix-vector multiplication. That's likely why you're seeing matrix-vector multiplication be so slow. Changing scipy so that it calls BLAS in the matrix-vector case could be a useful contribution to the package.\n",

      "Thanks to the comment of the user CJR, I worked out a satisfying solution. In fact, I found a library on GitHub (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/sparse_dot) which wraps the MKL routine mkl_sparse_spmm for Python. This routine is for fast multiplication of two sparse matrices. So all I had to do was to extend the library and provide a similar wrapper for mkl_sparse_syrk. And this is exactly what I did (https://github.com/kostrykin/sparse_dot). I still have to add some comments, afterwards I will submit a pull request to the original project. However, here are the performance results, quite impressing: random.seed(0) X = random.randn(500, 5000) X[X < 0.8] = 0 X = scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(X) print(f'X sparsity: {100 * (1 - X.count_nonzero() / prod(X.shape)):5.2f} %') # X sparsity: 78.80 % expected_result = (X @ X.T).toarray() expected_result_triu = expected_result.copy() expected_result_triu[tril_indices(expected_result.shape[0], k=-1)] = 0 mkl_result1 = sparse_dot_mkl.dot_product_mkl(X, X.T) allclose(mkl_result1.toarray(), expected_result) # True mkl_result2 = sparse_dot_mkl.dot_product_transpose_mkl(X) allclose(mkl_result2.toarray(), expected_result_triu) # True %timeit X @ X.T # 197 ms ± 5.21 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) %timeit sparse_dot_mkl.dot_product_mkl(X, X.T) # 70.6 ms ± 593 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) %timeit sparse_dot_mkl.dot_product_transpose_mkl(X) # 34.2 ms ± 421 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) Using the generic dot product from MKL instead of the dot product implementation from scipy yields a speed-up of 279%. Using the specialized product for Gram matrix computation yields a speed-up of 576%. This is huge.\n",

Size probably is. I can't reproduce your error because when I try larger sizes my machine slows to a crawl and I have to interrupt the process. As given in the documentation, csr_matrix takes several kinds of input. It recognizes them based on the number of elements. I'd have to look at the code to remember the exact logic. But one method expects a tuple of 3 arrays or lists, another a tupe of 2 items, with the second being another tuple. The third is a numpy array. Your case, a list of lists doesn't fit any of those, but it probably trys to turn it into an array. a = np.array([[10 for i in range(M)] for j in range(N)]) Most likely your error message is the result of some sort memory error - you are trying to make too large of a matrix. A dense matrix 70000 square is big (at least on some machines) and a sparse one representing the same matrix will be even larger. It has to store each of the elements 3 times - once for value, and twice for coordinates.

      "First, a MCVexample would help the question a lot. I can only speculate about your row operations. A fundamental question - do the rows differ in their sparsity structure? Take the lil case.

Getting into definition directly here (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v0.14.0/scipy/sparse/base.py#L233) and then here (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v0.14.0/scipy/sparse/base.py#L282), you'll see that there are few checks done in Scipy. If you know what exact form you want, you could write your own method (modify your SciPy copy) and compute your product directly. Not sure how much that would help, though.

They do this in a packed way using vectors to store the nonzero values and their coordinates in a specific order. If an operation adds new nonzeros they typically can't be appended but must be inserted, which is what we see in the example and what makes it expensive.\n",

      "When I change your += to just = for your 2 sparse arrays: for row, col in zip(rows, cols): #freqs[row,col] += 1 freqs[row,col] = 1 their respective times are cut in half. What's consuming the most time is the indexing. With += it is has to do both a __getitem__ and a __setitem__. When the docs say that dok and lil are better for iterative construction they mean that it's easier to expand their underlying data structures than for the other formats. When I try to make a csr matrix with your code, I get a: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scipy/sparse/compressed.py:690: SparseEfficiencyWarning: Changing the sparsity structure of a csr_matrix is expensive. lil_matrix is more efficient. SparseEfficiencyWarning) and 30x slower speed. So the speed claims are relative to formats like csr, not relative to pure Python or numpy structures. You might want to look at the Python code for dok_matrix.__get_item__ and dok_matrix.__set_item__ to see what happens when you do freq[r,c]. A faster way to construct your dok would be: freqs = dok_matrix((1000,1000)) d = dict() for row, col in zip(rows, cols): d[(row, col)] = 1 freqs.update(d) taking advantage of the fact that a dok is a subclassed dictionary. Note that dok matrix is not a dictionary of dictionaries. Its keys are tuples like (50,50). Another fast way of constructing the same sparse array is: freqs = sparse.coo_matrix((np.ones(1000,int),(rows,cols))) In other words, since you already have the rows and cols arrays (or ranges), calculate the corresponding data array, and THEN construct the sparse array. But if you must perform sparse operations on your matrix between incremental growth steps, then dok or lil may be your best choices. Sparse matricies were developed for linear algebra problems, such as solving a linear equation with a large sparse matrix. I used them years ago in MATLAB to solve finite difference problems. For that work the calculation friendly csr format is the ultimate goal, and the coo format was a convenient initialization format. Now many of the SO scipy sparse questions arise from scikit-learn and text analysis problems. They are also used in a biological database files. But still the (data),(row,col) definition method works best. So sparse matrices were never intended for fast incremental creation. The traditional Python structures like dictionaries and lists are much better for that. Here's a faster dok iteration that takes advantage of its dictionary methods. update seems to work as fast as on a plain dictionary. get is about 3x faster the equivalent indexing (freq[row,col]). Indexing probably uses get, but must have a lot of overhead. def fast_dok(rows, cols): freqs = dok_matrix((1000,1000)) for row, col in zip(rows,cols): i = freqs.get((row,col),0) freqs.update({(row,col):i+1}) return freqs Skipping the get, and just doing freqs.update({(row,col): 1) is even faster - faster than the defaultdict of defaultdict example, and nearly as fast as simple dictionary initialization ({(r, c):1 for r,c in zip(rows, cols)})\n",

If you can split the database across logistic lines so that you do not join any queries from one to another, then you should have separate databases. Beyond that, the best configuration for a database is to have each database on one fast machine with lots of storage and very fast access times. If you do this, the only thing that will slow down your database are bad queries or poorly-indexed tables.

Tl;dr Database: PostgreSQL as it is good for CSV, free and open source. Tool: Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org/) is a good fit for such type of tasks. Good performance. DB Regarding database, it is an important thing to decide. What to pick and how it will work in future with such amount of data. It is definitely should be a separate server instance in order not to generate an additional load on the main database instance and not to block other applications. NoSQL I thought about the usage of Cassandra here, but this solution would be too complex right now. Cassandra does not have ad-hoc queries. Cassandra data storage layer is basically a key-value storage system. It means that you must \"model\" your data around the queries you need, rather than around the structure of the data itself. RDBMS I didn't want to overengineer here. And I stopped the choice here. MS SQL Server It is a way to go, but the big downside here is pricing. Pretty expensive. Enterprise edition costs a lot of money taking into account our hardware. Regarding pricing, you could read this policy document (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/sql-server-pricing). Another drawback here was the support of CSV files. This will be the main data source for us here. MS SQL Server can neither import nor export CSV. MS SQL Server silently truncating a text field. MS SQL Server's text encoding handling going wrong. MS SQL Server throwing an error message because it doesn't understand quoting or escaping. More on that comparison could be found in the article PostgreSQL vs. MS SQL Server (http://www.pg-versus-ms.com/). PostgreSQL This database is a mature product and well battle-tested too. I heard a lot of positive feedback on it from others (of course, there are some tradeoffs too). It has a more classic SQL syntax, good CSV support, moreover, it is open source. It is worth to mention that SSMS (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx) is a way better than PGAdmin (https://www.pgadmin.org/). SSMS (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx) has an autocomplete feature, multiple results (when you run several queries and get the several results at one, but in PGAdmin (https://www.pgadmin.org/) you get the last one only). Anyway, right now I'm using DataGrip (https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) from JetBrains. Processing Tool I've looked through Spring Batch (http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/) and Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org/). Spring Batch (http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/) is a bit too low-level thing to use for this task and also Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org/) provides the ability to scale easier if it will be needed in future. Anyway, Spring Batch (http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/) could also do this work too. Regarding Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org/) example, the code could be found in learning-spark (https://github.com/databricks/learning-spark/blob/master/src/main/java/com/oreilly/learningsparkexamples/java/BasicLoadWholeCsv.java) project. My choice is Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org/) for now.\n",

      "If you want to analyze data based on columns and aggregates, ORC or Parquet are better. If you don't plan on managing Hadoop infrastructure, then Hive or HBase wouldn't be acceptable. I agree a SQL Server might struggle with large queries... Out of the options listed, that narrows it down to BigQuery. If you want to explore alternative solutions in the same space, Apache Pinot or Druid support analytical use cases. Otherwise, throw files (as parquet or ORC) into GCS and use pyspark\n",

      "I think that any of them would probably be fine. However, your configuration of the different databases for what you are trying to do would be different based on your application. Suggested place to start: look for apps similar to yours. See what they are using, if you can. Then start testing the different databases with similar configurations and see what works for you. Personally I've used Oracle, MySql, and Postgres over the last 11 years and they've all worked well. It's really all in your configuration, which is where a good DBA comes in handy.\n",

      "This depends on you NFR (non functional requirements). Next to load balancing, a cluster provides higher availability. You'll have to make your back-end state-less so that requests from the same user can end up on another node without the user noticing. This makes it more expensive to build scaling software. So consider your options carefully. Accessing a database from multiple servers is not different than accessing it from multiple threads.\n",

      "The only answer possible at this point is 'try it and see'.

      "The worry you'll have, which will become less of a concern as time goes on, is whether you'll have users with inadequate memory to handle those millions of rows in an embedded database. When everyone has a 64 bit operating system and 8GB of RAM or more you'll be in the clear. I agree that SQLLite or Hypersonic can handle it as long as there's sufficient memory. I'd wonder what each will do for those situations where memory becomes scarce. You certainly have the option to run Hypersonic in server mode and let it keep data on disk. This might be an attractive alternative, especially as SSDs become prevalent. You can keep the convenience of not requiring a database install and still manage large data sets without exhausting available RAM.\n",

      "Java database such as JavaDB (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/overview/index.html) (aka Derby (http://db.apache.org/derby/)), HSQLDB (http://hsqldb.org/) or the more recent H2 (http://www.h2database.com/) (by the original author of HSQLDB) in embedded mode are all possible candidates. Between them JavaDB tend to be considered as the most robust (full ACID, robustness against failures, unlimited db size etc) and would be my choice. Here is a quick summary of the reasons: H2 is very interesting and I use it for testing (its compatibility mode (http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#compatibility) feature is really great) but I'm not sure of its maturity for production use. H2 and HSQLDB are faster than Derby because they do not sync data to disk on commit - while Derby does. So performance comes from the lack of Durability. If you change this behavior, they all hit the some bottleneck: disk IO (http://kasparov.skife.org/blog-live/src/java/h2-aci.writeback). HSQLDB only supports dirty read (http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/doc/guide/ch02.html#N104FC), transactions see uncommitted values from other transactions. HSQLDB is not fully Atomic (http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/doc/guide/ch02.html#N104FC), a transaction can be partially(WTF?) committed Derby is more powerful, has specs compliant drivers, scales well. Don't misinterpret me, I'm not saying HSQLDB is bad but you need to know what you're dealing with and in which context/application. Sometimes speed is more important (e.g. for unit testing), and sometimes it is data integrity. If you are in the latter case, Java DB is IMO a better choice. Some of the references below are 2/3 years old but I'm not aware of any revolution. If I made some mistake, let me know, I'll be happy to update my answer to make it accurate.

      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the recommended technology stack for this scenario is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Database**: PostgreSQL\n",
      "   - PostgreSQL is chosen due to its maturity, good CSV support, classic SQL syntax, and being open source. It offers better performance compared to Microsoft SQL Server and handles CSV files efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Processing Tool**: Apache Spark\n",
      "   - Apache Spark is selected for its ability to handle large volumes of data and scale easily if required in the future. It provides good performance and can process data quickly, making it suitable for handling 300k SQL requests per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure scalability and redundancy, the architecture should include separate database instances dedicated solely to processing the high volume of SQL requests. This separation allows the main database instance to operate independently and prevents it from becoming a bottleneck.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of database configuration, each database instance should reside on a fast machine with ample storage and high-speed access times. Proper indexing and query optimization are crucial to avoid slowdowns caused by poorly designed queries. Synchronization between databases should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and even then, it should be implemented with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, considering the scale of operations, a distributed computing approach may be beneficial. Utilizing a cluster of machines with load balancers can enhance availability and fault tolerance. Making the backend stateless ensures that requests from the same user can be directed to different nodes without disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the proposed architecture aims to distribute the workload effectively and maintain high performance under heavy loads. Monitoring and regular profiling of queries and indexes will help identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the system further.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to export your UserContext, so it can be imported in the components that need it: export const UserContext = React.createContext(); function App() { const [name, setName] = useState('Name'); return ( <UserContext.Provider value={{ name, setName }}> <Home /> </UserContext.Provider> ); } Afterwards you can import it in your App component: import { UserContext } '../../App' function Home() { const user = useContext(UserContext); return ( <> <label>Your name:</label> <input type='text' onChange={e => user.setName(e.target.value)} /> <p>{user.name}</p> </> ) }\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have missed to initialize an initial state function before rendering. ... getInitialState: function() { return {username: ''}; }, render: function() { .... } Now this.state.username should be accessable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the \"user.username\" in the CurrentInfo block outputs as undefined. Any insight? This: this.state = { user: [ { username: \"test\" } ] } should be: this.state = {user: {username: \"test\"}}; You're currently setting the user property to an array. It is also worth noting, that I receive a warning of: Uncaught Error: _registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element. This is probably happening in code that is not in your question.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have a naming collision. You have both import User from \"./components/User\"; and const [User, setUser] = useState(null) This is one reason why precise variable names and following the standard conventions are useful - something that isn't a component nor a class probably shouldn't have a variable that starts with a capital letter. Consider calling the state userData instead, and then you can pass it down to the child as a prop for the child to parse as desired, for example const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null) return ( <User userData={userData} /> ) function User ({ userData }){ return <div>User {userData ? userData.fullName : ''}</div> }```\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue It seems the initial value of your context is undefined. var user: any, setUser: any; const AuthUserContext = React.createContext({ user, setUser }); // both undefined Solution Define the shape of the context. var user: any, setUser: any; const AuthUserContext = React.createContext({ user: '', setUser: () => {}, // <-- indicate setUser is a function }); See Updating Context from a Nested Component (https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#updating-context-from-a-nested-component)\n",
      "\n",
      "The update state doesn't work like that. react create a queue for state update so we can not get the latest value right after the update call. since you are console.log(contextUsername) right after setUserName it console's undefined. and don't pass updateState-method(ex. setUserName) directly in context create method to change state value from there call updateState-method(ex. setUserName) like const UpdateUserName = (value) =>{ setUserName(value) } if you want to check the updated value of contextUsername use useEffect useEffect(() => { console.log(contextUsername); },[contextUsername])\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to either export the UserContext from your App.js file after creating it there or create a new file say, UserContext.js, which export the context. From there, you need to import UserContext from the file where NavBar is declared. And also it seems like you are missing render() within App component. e.g.) UserContext.js import {createContext} from 'react'; const UserContext = createContext(); export default UserContext; App.js import React from 'react'; import Header from 'components/Header'; import UserContext from './UserContext'; class App extends React.Component { constructor () { super(); this.state = { firstName: \"Bob\", lastName: \"Joe\", } } render() { const {firstName,lastName} = this.state; return ( <UserContext.Provider value = {{firstName,lastName}}> <Header/> </UserContext.Provider> ) } } components/Header.js // other react imports omitted... import UserContext from '../UserContext'; class Header extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"header\"> <NavBar/> </div> ); } } function NavBar () { const {firstName,lastName} = useContext(UserContext); } return ( <nav className=\"navbar\"> <span> Hello, {firstName} {lastName} </span> </nav> ) } And as a side note, pass the whole this.state object as value of the context instead of destructuring like {firstName, lastName} because it'd cause your child components re-render everytime as you are passing a new object reference. So the recommended way is something like, class App extends React.Component { // ... other codes omitted for brevity render() { return ( <UserContext.Provider value = {this.state}> <Header/> </UserContext.Provider> ) } }\n",
      "\n",
      "The code shown so far is correct, with one exception. const {name} = React.useContext(UserContext); The value name is being destructured from the return of useContext. This is fine if the value being given is an object, but I assume it's not. <UserContext.Provider value={name}> If name is not an object, but a string, then the destructure will not work, and name will be undefined. To solve this you have two options: Do not destructure the name value const name = React.useContent(UserContext); Pass the provider an object <UserContext.Provider value={{name}}> React uses curly braces {} to denote a JavaScript expression (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44181303/use-of-curly-braces-in-react#44181455), whereas the inner curly braces is an object literal property value shorthand (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34467262/object-literal-property-value-shorthand-incompatible-with-this).\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The issue is that you haven't imported LoggedUser into the Reply component You should be calling React.createContext outside of your component, and you should export the result. Example: import React from 'react' export const LoggedUser = React.createContext(Data.currentUser.username) export function App() { const [content, setContent] = useState((Data)) const comments = content.comments return ( <LoggedUser.Provider value={Data.currentUser.username}> {/* etc */ </LoggedUser.Provider> ) } import React from 'react' import { LoggedUser } from './App.js' //or wherever it is export function Reply(props) { const user = React.useContext(LoggedUser) //etc } It may also help to use named imports instead of default imports if you are exporting multiple things from a file.\n",

      "Please provide your best answer below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "You need to define the initial state of the context when you create it. In your case, the context is `AuthUserContext`, and it's missing an initial state. Here's how you can define it:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "const AuthUserContext = React.createContext({\n",
      "  user: '', // Set an initial state here\n",
      "  setUser: () => {}, // Initialize an empty function as setUser\n",
      "});\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, ensure that you're not causing a naming collision by using the same name for a variable (`User`) and a component (`User`). It's better to use descriptive names to avoid confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, make sure you're not trying to access the context value immediately after updating it. React has a batching mechanism for state updates, so the value might not be updated yet when you try to log it. Instead, use the `useEffect` hook to log the context value after it has been updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how to use the context correctly:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "import React, { useContext, useEffect, useState } from'react';\n",
      "\n",
      "// Define the context with initial state\n",
      "const AuthUserContext = React.createContext({\n",
      "  user: '',\n",
      "  setUser: () => {},\n",
      "});\n",
      "\n",
      "function App() {\n",
      "  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n",

      "1. **Element Accessibility**: When you use `find_elements_by_id`, it returns a list of WebElements. You can't directly use `find_element_by_xpath` on this list; instead, you should iterate over the list and apply `find_element_by_xpath` to each element. However, since you mentioned needing to find the first match, you can use `find_element_by_id` directly, as it only returns the first matching element.\n",

      "If you are new to programming then this might not be clear but if you think about how you would implement a max() function you only need to iterate through the list one time, a list of n elements. So the complexity would be at most O(n). However you have to assume that whoever wrote any built-in method has optimized it. Hence O(n) is an upper bound on the complexity. The best thing you can do now or in the future is to look at the documentation about the function you are using, either it will tell you the complexity or by looking at the code you will be able to extrapolate it yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a general unsorted array, you can never find the max in anything less than O(n) time. The very trivial proof: if you do it in less than O(n) time, then for a sufficiently large array you don't have enough time to inspect every element. An adversary can therefore put the maximum value in an element you don't check, making your algorithm incorrect. What the original code is good for is finding both the maximum and minimum simultaneously using fewer than 2n comparisons (as the naive implementation would do) -- it uses approximately 1.5n comparisons since it performs only one comparison when there are two elements. You derive no benefit from using it to only find the maximum: you'd be better off using max(arr) in Python instead (which would also be faster since it has no function call overhead). The original code stores the values in a[1] through a[n], which requires an array of size n+1. Therefore you should put a dummy element in the first position. But, more problematically, your translation is incorrect. The original uses globals to effect a multiple value return (which is an incredibly hacky way to do it), and local variables to save the old globals. Since you make both max1 and max2 global, the function will not produce the right answer anyway. The correct translation to Python would use a direct multiple value return with a tuple: def minmax(arr, i, j): if i==j: return arr[i], arr[i] elif i==j-1: if arr[i] < arr[j]: return arr[i], arr[j] else: return arr[j], arr[i] else: mid = (i+j)//2 min1, max1 = minmax(arr, i, mid) min2, max2 = minmax(arr, mid+1, j) if min2 < min1: min1 = min2 if max2 > max1: max1 = max2 return min1, max1\n",

      "Look at the code. It has 2 nested loops: The outer loop iterates over the positions val. The inner loop finds the index of the value that should be at the index val, i.e., max_pos. It takes a lot of time just to find the index. Instead, I will compute the index of each value and store it in a dict. index_of = {value: index for index, value in enumerate(arr)} (note that because all values in arr are distinct, there should be no duplicated keys) And also prepare a sorted version of the array: that way it's easier to find the maximum value instead of having to loop over the array. sorted_arr = sorted(arr) Then do the rest similar to the original code: for each index visited, use sorted_arr to get the max, use index_of to get its current index, if it's out-of-place then swap. Remember to update the index_of dict while swapping too. The algorithm takes O(n) operations (including dict indexing/modifying), plus sorting cost of n elements (which is about O(n log n)). Note: If the array arr only contains integers in a small range, it may be faster to make index_of an array instead of a dict.\n",

      "The reason your program takes too long is that your nested loop inherently means quadratic time. The outer loop goes through N-1 indices. The inner loop goes through a different number of indices each time, but the average is obviously (N-1)/2 rounded up. So, the total number of times through the inner loop is (N-1) * (N-1)/2, which is O(N^2). For the maximum N=1000000, that means 499999000001 iterations. That's going to take a long time. The trick is to find a way to do this in linear time. Here's one solution (as a vague description, rather than actual code, so someone can't just copy and paste it when they face the same test as you): Make a list of the smallest value before each index. Each one is just min(smallest_values[-1], arr[i]), and obviously you can do this in N steps. Make a list of the largest value after each index. The simplest way to do this is to reverse the list, do the exact same loop as above (but with max instead of min), then reverse again. (Reversing a list takes N steps, of course.) Now, for each element in the list, instead of comparing to every other element, you just have to compare to smallest_values[i] and largest_values[i]. Since you're only doing 2 comparisons for each of the N values, this takes 2N time. So, even being lazy and naive, that's a total of N + 3N + 2N steps, which is O(N). If N=1000000, that means 6000000 steps, which is a whole lot faster than 499999000001. You can obviously see how to remove the two reverses, and how to skip the first and last comparisons. If you're smart, you can see how to take the whole largest_values out of the equation entirely. Ultimately, I think you can get it down to 2N - 3 steps, or 1999997. But that's all just a small constant improvement; nowhere near as important as fixing the basic algorithmic problem. You'd probably get a bigger improvement than 3x (maybe 20x), for less work, by just running the naive code in PyPy instead of CPython, or by converting to NumPy—but you're not going to get the 83333x improvement in any way other than changing the algorithm.\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided code snippet is implementing a recursive function `max()` to find the maximum element in an array. Let's analyze the time complexity of this function.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Base Case**: When `i` equals the length of the array (`len(arr)`), the function returns the current maximum value (`max_val`). This operation takes constant time, O(1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recursive Case**: In each recursive call, the function compares the current element (`arr[i]`) with the current maximum value (`max_val`). If the current element is greater than the current maximum, it updates `max_val` and makes another recursive call with `i + 1`. Otherwise, it simply makes another recursive call with `i + 1` without updating `max_val`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1 (`i + 1`).\n",
      "   - The number of recursive calls is equal to the length of the array minus 1 (`len(arr) - 1`).\n",
      "   - In each recursive call, the function performs a constant amount of work: comparing the current element with the current maximum and potentially updating `max_val`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the number of recursive calls is proportional to the size of the input (the length of the array), and each recursive call performs a constant amount of work, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's essential to note that the given code has several issues, such as using the variable name `max` (which shadows the built-in Python function) and incorrectly handling the base case. The corrected version of the function should return the maximum value instead of the index when the recursion reaches the end of the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize, the time complexity of the given code is O(n), assuming the array has a fixed size and the comparison and assignment operations take constant time.\n",

      "How do \"click\" and \"onclick\" differ when using jQuery to create an element?\n",

      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer focus' on the difference between the two uses of .on() described in the question. Not the difference between the selectors. The difference between the two is that the first example $(document).on('click','p',function(){ // }); Makes use of event bubbling (or event delegation). This is particularly useful when you have applications that heavily manipulate the DOM that remove and add lots of elements. (Angular or Backbone applications for example that use their respective routers to switch views). Event bubbling allows you to bind to a lower level, static element but have the event target a nested element that can be removed and added as many times as you wish and maintain the event binding. Your second example $('p[class=\"classname\"]').on('click',function(){ // }); Binds an event directly to the element. If this element never changes this is fine. If it is removed at any point this binding is lost and would need to be redeclared once it has been re-added to the DOM. This can be a tedious process to say the least. As a result I always use your first option even on 'undynamic' elements just in case I change my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because you might have a dynamically generated elements (for example coming from an AJAX call), you might want to have the same click handler that was previously bound to the same element selector, you then \"delegate\" the click event using on() with selector argument To demonstrate: http://jsfiddle.net/AJRw3/ (http://jsfiddle.net/AJRw3/) on() can also be synonymous with click() if you don't have a selector specified: $('.elementClass').click(function() { // code }); is synonymous with $('.elementClass').on('click', function() { // code }); In the sense that it only add the handler one time to all elements with class elementClass. If you have a new elementClass coming from, for example $('<div class=\"elementClass\" />'), the handler won't be bound on that new element, you need to do: $('#container').on('click', '.elementClass', function() { // code }); Assuming #container is .elementClass's ancestor\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference is e.g. that the first version $('#myId .someClass').on('click', function (e) { ... binds the click event to all .someClass elements that are descendants of the element with the id #myId and are already in the DOM when the page is loaded, while the second version $('#myId').on('click', '.someClass', function (e) { .. will delegate the click event from the #myId element to all descendant elements with the class .someClass, even if they are dynamically added later. For reference: http://api.jquery.com/on/ (http://api.jquery.com/on/) As one essential quote from there, section \"Direct and delegated events\": Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on().\n",
      "\n",
      "$(document).on('click', 'someselector', function() ...); is delegation syntax. It allows you to bind a handler to elements that may not exist at the time that you execute the code. See: Event binding on dynamically created elements? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements) $('someselector').on('click', function() ...); only binds the handler to the element(s) matching the selector at the time you execute this code.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLTR The explanation of all the above specified methods are given below. $(document).on(\"click\", \"#id\", function (e) { }); This way of binding events, called event delegation, on the the document or a static parent element(say body) rather than to a particular specific element is done in case of dynamic DOM manipulation. A good example is that, think about a situation where you want to bind an event to a DOM element which may not be there when the page is loaded, but will be introduced into the DOM at a later stage by remote loading or by dynamic DOM manipulation. Your code won't be neat if you bind the events for newly introduced elements right after it is introduced in the DOM. So in such cases we use the above method to bind the events initially so that we don't have to worry whether the element is there or not while the binding happens. Here the click event is binded to the document and then delegated to the element specified. Since this is binded to the document or a static parent, the event propagation time will be more, i.e. event propagation will be slow, compared to the second method. But this is the preferred way of doing it. $(\"#id\").on(\"click\", function (e) { }) This kind of binding is used in cases where the DOM need not be static, but the element you specify has be present while you bind the event. Usually we do this in static DOM element cases. The only thing is that this kind of binding can be used only when that particular element onto which the event has to be binded is already present in the DOM. Since this is a direct binding and does not involve any delegation event propagation will be fast compared to method 1. Since the first kind of binding is done on the document, it will be slow compared to the second one in which event is directly binded onto the specific element. $(\"#id\").die('click').live(\"click\",function(e){ }); and $(\"#id\").live(\"click\",function(e){ }); have been deprecated in jQuery 1.7 and removed in jQuery 1.9. \"Since all .live() events are attached at the document element, events take the longest and slowest possible path before they are handled.\" - Quoted from https://api.jquery.com/live/ (https://api.jquery.com/live/). This is answer for your question, which method is faster? Method 2 > Method 1 > Method 3 & 4 But still Method 1 is the preferred method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the way they are written, there is not much difference in what they do. However, I do want to mention that they would behave differently for a dynamically added button. For example, if the button were to be added on the page dynamically after the initial load, the 'onclick' attribute will still work as it is able to register the event listener. On the other hand, if you use a jquery click function (Eg $('button').on('click',function(){}), adding the button dynamically will not register the event listener. In that case you have to use event delegation like $('someStaticParentDiv').on('click',\"button\",function(){})\n",
      "\n",
      "It's basically how association is made to the element. .click applies to the current DOM, while .on (using delegation) will continue to be valid for new elements added to the DOM after event association. Which is better to use, I'd say it depends on the case. Example: <ul id=\"todo\"> <li>Do 1</li> <li>Do 2</li> <li>To do 3</li> <li>Do 4</li> </ul> .Click Event: $(\"li\").click(function () { $(this).remove (); }); Event .on: $(\"#todo\").on(\"click\", \"li\", function () { $(this).remove(); }); Note that I've separated the selector in the .on. I'll explain why. Let us suppose that after this association, let us do the following: $(\"#todo\").append(\"<li>Do 5</li>\"); That is where you will notice the difference. If the event was associated via .click, task 5 will not obey the click event, and so it will not be removed. If it was associated via .on, with the selector separate, it will obey.\n",
      "\n",
      "$(document).on(\"click\", \"a\", function () { will bind the event on the a elements which are not present at the time of binding event. This is called as event delegation (http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/). Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future. Whereas $(\"a\").click(function () { will bind events only to the a elements which are present in DOM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second way uses a lazy event handler. This means that if you manipulate the DOM after you have initialized these events, only the second method will work. This is because the second event handler attaches to the document and not the #someID element directly. Whenever the user clicks in the document, jQuery will determine if the clicked element matches the #someID selector, and only then will it fire the configured event. This allows you to add the #someID element at a later point, even after the events have been configured. The official name for this is event delegation, and you can find more info and examples here (http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/). Edit: note that there is a performance penalty when using the second method. This is because jQuery has to search through your entire document for matching elements on every click. While #someID can probably be matched in a very fast, performant manner, you should at least be aware of this mechanism. If you still want the advantage of having lazy events but want to minimize the performance overhead, I would advise you to narrow the scope in which jQuery has to search. For example, if the #someID element will always appear in the #someContainer element, you should configure your event like this: $(\"#someContainer\").on(\"click\", \"#someID\", SomeFunction); Another thing to note is that this method can also have performance gains. I am speaking from personal experience and have no benchmarks to prove this, but I noticed a smoother experience when using this method on a large collection of objects, for example a ul tag with lots of li tags, where each li tag needed an event listener. In this scenario, it was better to attach one event listener to the ul tag rather than attach n events to n li tags.\n",

      "In jQuery, `click` and `onclick` are not directly comparable as they serve different purposes. `click` is a method provided by jQuery for handling click events, while `onclick` is a HTML attribute used to handle click events.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when discussing the usage of `.on()` in jQuery, there are two main ways to bind a click event:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Directly to an element: `$('p[class=\"classname\"]').on('click', function(){ // });`\n",
      "   - This method binds the click event directly to the element(s) that match the selector at the time the code is executed.\n",
      "   - If the element is removed from the DOM and later re-added, the click event binding will be lost and needs to be re-applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Using event delegation with `.on()` on a parent element: `$('body').on('click', 'p[class=\"classname\"]', function(){ // });`\n",
      "   - This method binds the click event to a parent element (in this case, the body), allowing it to capture click events on child elements that may not yet exist or may be dynamically added later.\n",
      "   - Even if elements are added or removed from the DOM, the event binding remains intact as long as they are descendants of the parent element.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key differences between these two approaches are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dynamic DOM manipulation**: Event delegation is crucial when dealing with dynamically added or removed elements, ensuring that click events remain functional regardless of changes to the DOM structure.\n",

Delegating events reduces this overhead by maintaining a single event handler on the parent element.\n",

      "If I understand correctly you want to import the result of a tool in SonarQube to track certain metrics over time. The best course of action in my opinion would be to write a plugin not to compute the metrics but to import the report generated by your tool. That is probably the best reusable option and you don't have to reinvent the wheel and benefit from SonarQube features. This is how the coverage plugins are usually written (for java). You can have a look at Cobertura or Clover plugin or even Generic Coverage plugin to see how at SonarSource we write those kind of plugins.\n",

Note that the 2nd option (use of the switch off plugin) works only if you're using the SQALE plugin (http://www.sonarsource.com/products/plugins/governance/sqale/), which embeds the \"sqale-java:DuplicatedBlocksCheck\" rule.\n",

      "SonarQube does not store the metrics for classes and methods, but only for files, directories, modules and projects.

Currently supported SonarQube versions are v3.7.4, v4.0 and v4.1. But we almost done with new version of the plugin (version 6.0), that supports from SQ 4.2 to 4.3.2. You can find an online demo here (http://sonarqube.frontendart.com/). UPDATE: If you want to get class or method level metrics through the Web Service API (http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Web+Service+API), then you should call the setQualifiers() (http://docs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/org/sonar/wsclient/services/ResourceQuery.html#setQualifiers(java.lang.String...)) method of your ResourceQuery object. The qualifier of a method is \"MET\" and \"JavaClass\" for a JAVA class. You can try it in your browser, just change the URL bar to {localhost:9000}/api/resources?metrics=ncloc&qualifiers=MET. For example on our online demo: http://sonarqube.frontendart.com/api/resources?resource=506268&depth=-1&metrics=ncloc&qualifiers=MET (http://sonarqube.frontendart.com/api/resources?resource=506268&depth=-1&metrics=ncloc&qualifiers=MET)\n",

Create or edit sonar-project.properties into the root folder of your project Add the following line : sonar.timemachine.period1=previous_analysis Solution 3 : Set as a parameter of command line The last solution is to add an argument of the command line to take into account the parameter.

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "To navigate to the most recently added entry in an array using `ng-repeat`, you can utilize the `$last` property provided by AngularJS within the directive. The `$last` property returns `true` if the current element being iterated over in the loop is the last element in the array. Here's how you can achieve this:\n",
      "\n",
      "```html\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "  <li ng-repeat=\"item in list\" ng-class=\"{last: $last}\">\n",
      "    {{item}}\n",
      "  </li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In the above example, the `ng-class` directive applies a CSS class named `last` to the last item in the list, which you can then style differently to highlight it as the newly added entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you want to dynamically set focus on the newly added item when it appears in the list, you can modify your controller logic slightly:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "function MyCtrl($scope) {\n",
      "  $scope.list = [\"item 1\", \"item 2\", \"item 3\", \"item 4\", \"item 5\"];\n",
      "\n",
      "  $scope.addItem = function () {\n",
      "    // Add a new item to the array\n",
      "    $scope.list.push(\"new item\");\n",
      "\n",
      "    // Set focus to the newly added item\n",
      "    setTimeout(function () {\n",
      "      document.querySelector('.last').focus(); // Assuming.last is the class applied to the newly added item\n",
      "    }, 0);\n",
      "  };\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach uses `setTimeout` with a delay of zero milliseconds to immediately execute the focus command after adding the new item to the array. Note that `.last` should match the class applied to the newly added item via `ng-class`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that AngularJS automatically tracks changes to the scope model (`$scope.list`), and thus it will only re-render and update the DOM for the parts of the template that have changed. This ensures efficient rendering and avoids unnecessary layout thrashing.\n",

As OP mentioned in question, the JSON is parsed correctly, the reason why [Object] is displayed in result is: when JavaScript Object is returned to display, it would be converted to String first by toString() automatically, which will make all object (including array) as [Object] in text. To display the real content, JSON.stringify() need to be invoked.

Converting a typed array to a standard array using Array.from (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from?v=example) before encoding would work, for example: var myTypedArray = new Float32Array([0.1, 323.3, 0, 2.2]); console.log(JSON.stringify(myTypedArray)); // looks like an object var stdArray = Array.from(myTypedArray); console.log(JSON.stringify(stdArray)); // looks like an array Then to convert the JSON back to a typed array: var json = \"[0.1, 323.3, 0, 2.2]\"; var myTypedArray = new Float32Array(JSON.parse(json));\n",
      "\n",
      "From the documentation (https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) we can see that... When data is an object, jQuery generates the data string from the object's key/value pairs unless the processData option is set to false. For example, { a: \"bc\", d: \"e,f\" } is converted to the string \"a=bc&d=e%2Cf\". If the value is an array, jQuery serializes multiple values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting (described below). For example, { a: [1,2] } becomes the string \"a%5B%5D=1&a%5B%5D=2\" with the default traditional: false setting. fetch doesn't do that. But separately, you've said you're sending JSON by including Content-Type: application/json as a header, but you aren't doing that (and your jQuery code doesn't do that either, it sends URI-encoded data). You have to do it yourself. If you want to send JSON, use JSON.stringify: const options = { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }; If you want to send URI-encoded data, use URLSearchParams: const data = new URLSearchParams([ // Note this is an array of [\"name\", \"John\"], // [name, value] arrays [\"data\", \"Boston\"], ]); const options = { method: 'POST', body: data, }; If you want to send standard form encoding, use FormData (exactly like the above, but with FormData instead of URLSearchParams. Also how come this fetch implementation is producing an error in my node terminal ? If I use a digit instead of 'Boston' for example the Unexpected token changes to '<' . SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1 at JSON.parse (<anonymous>) Because your object is being coerced to a string, and it coerces to \"[object Object]\", which is invalid JSON as of the o. Side note: Your fetch code is falling prey to a footgun in the API: fetch only rejects its promise on network error, not on HTTP error. You can't assume that a fulfilled promise from fetch means your request was successful, you have to check: const response = await fetch('/api ',options); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(\"HTTP error \" + response.status); } const responseData = await response.json(); console.log(responseData);\n",

Since converting a Float32Array to an array of numbers won't be lossy, and maintains the semantics well, that's what I'd do: const original = Float32Array.of(20, 250, 444); const json = JSON.stringify(Array.from(original)); console.log(json); const received = new Float32Array(JSON.parse(json)); console.log(received); If this array is part of a greater structure, you may need a replacer function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Syntax) with JSON.stringify and reviver function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Syntax) for JSON.parse.\n",

      "Since the time of the other answer, NumPy has added the numpy.partition (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.partition.html) and numpy.argpartition (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argpartition.html) functions for partial sorting, allowing you to do this in O(arr.size) time, or O(arr.size+n*log(n)) if you need the elements in sorted order. numpy.partition(arr, n) returns an array the size of arr where the nth element is what it would be if the array were sorted. All smaller elements come before that element and all greater elements come afterward. numpy.argpartition is to numpy.partition as numpy.argsort is to numpy.sort. Here's how you would use these functions to find the indices of the minimum n elements of a two-dimensional arr: flat_indices = numpy.argpartition(arr.ravel(), n-1)[:n] row_indices, col_indices = numpy.unravel_index(flat_indices, arr.shape) And if you need the indices in order, so row_indices[0] is the row of the minimum element instead of just one of the n minimum elements: min_elements = arr[row_indices, col_indices] min_elements_order = numpy.argsort(min_elements) row_indices, col_indices = row_indices[min_elements_order], col_indices[min_elements_order] The 1D case is a lot simpler: # Unordered: indices = numpy.argpartition(arr, n-1)[:n] # Extra code if you need the indices in order: min_elements = arr[indices] min_elements_order = numpy.argsort(min_elements) ordered_indices = indices[min_elements_order]\n",

      "argmin (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.argmin.html) will give you the index of the first minimum element in each column. Numpy does not generally support ragged arrays, so you will need to jump through extra hoops to get the lists you want. A good way to start is probably to create a mask of the elements of interest: mask = (x == x.min(axis=0, keepdims=True)) You can convert the mask to indices using something like np.nonzero (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nonzero.html). I would probably do it on a partially raveled array: row, col = np.nonzero(mask.reshape(mask.shape[0], -1)) You can then take row and split it on unique values of col, so that you have arrays of indices in each column, arranged in a list. You will need to sort on col first though: sort_order = col.argsort() row = row[sort_order] col = col[sort_order] A more clever (but less general) approach, is to call np.nonzero with the dimensions reversed so that the automatic sort on the first index takes care of all that for you: col, row = np.nonzero(mask.reshape(mask.shape[0], -1).T) The actual split is pretty easy now: row = np.split(row, np.flatnonzero(np.diff(col)) + 1) You can then emplace the resulting indices into an array of dtype=object to allow raggedness: result = np.reshape(row, x.shape[1:]) This simplified approach will raise a warning in more recent versions of numpy, so you should probably do the following instead: result = np.empty(x.shape[1:], dtype=object) result.ravel()[:] = row\n",

However, your modification appears to generate permutations as opposed to combinations. If you want the permutations, consider that those permutations which are solutions to the sum(numbers) == target condition are also permutations of the elements of those combinations which are solutions to the same. So what you may want to do instead is find the combinations which satisfy the relation and take the permutations of the elements of those solutions to get all permutations of the list which are solutions of the condition. i.e., from itertools import combinations, permutations def subset_sum(numbers, target): for length in range(len(numbers)): for combination in combinations(numbers, length): if sum(combination) == target: for permutation in permutations(combination, len(combination)): print(\"sum({}) = {}\".format(list(permutation), target)) s = [2, 4] k = [22, 25, -11, 13, 58] x = [100, 101, 23] v = [77, 88, 99] y = s + k + x + v if __name__ == \"__main__\": subset_sum(y, 47) Note that calling subset_sum(k, 47) still prints the same solutions: sum([22, 25]) = 47 sum([25, 22]) = 47 sum([-11, 58]) = 47 sum([58, -11]) = 47 And calling subset_sum(y, 47) prints: sum([22, 25]) = 47 sum([25, 22]) = 47 sum([-11, 58]) = 47 sum([58, -11]) = 47 sum([2, 22, 23]) = 47 sum([2, 23, 22]) = 47 sum([22, 2, 23]) = 47 sum([22, 23, 2]) = 47 sum([23, 2, 22]) = 47 sum([23, 22, 2]) = 47 sum([22, -11, 13, 23]) = 47 sum([22, -11, 23, 13]) = 47 sum([22, 13, -11, 23]) = 47 sum([22, 13, 23, -11]) = 47 sum([22, 23, -11, 13]) = 47 sum([22, 23, 13, -11]) = 47 sum([-11, 22, 13, 23]) = 47 sum([-11, 22, 23, 13]) = 47 sum([-11, 13, 22, 23]) = 47 sum([-11, 13, 23, 22]) = 47 sum([-11, 23, 22, 13]) = 47 sum([-11, 23, 13, 22]) = 47 sum([13, 22, -11, 23]) = 47 sum([13, 22, 23, -11]) = 47 sum([13, -11, 22, 23]) = 47 sum([13, -11, 23, 22]) = 47 sum([13, 23, 22, -11]) = 47 sum([13, 23, -11, 22]) = 47 sum([23, 22, -11, 13]) = 47 sum([23, 22, 13, -11]) = 47 sum([23, -11, 22, 13]) = 47 sum([23, -11, 13, 22]) = 47 sum([23, 13, 22, -11]) = 47 sum([23, 13, -11, 22]) = 47 If, however, you only want the combinations, the code is simply: from itertools import combinations, permutations def subset_sum(numbers, target): for length in range(len(numbers)): for combination in combinations(numbers, length): if sum(combination) == target: print(\"sum({}) = {}\".format(list(combination), target)) s = [2, 4] k = [22, 25, -11, 13, 58] x = [100, 101, 23] v = [77, 88, 99] y = s + k + x + v if __name__ == \"__main__\": subset_sum(y, 47) Where calling subset_sum(k, 47) prints: sum([22, 25]) = 47 sum([-11, 58]) = 47 And calling subset_sum(y, 47) prints: sum([22, 25]) = 47 sum([-11, 58]) = 47 sum([2, 22, 23]) = 47 sum([22, -11, 13, 23]) = 47\n",

      "A Pure Python Solution (i.e. without itertools.product) The main difficulty here is executing a variable number of for-loops inside a function. The way we can get around this easily is using recursion which involves a function calling itself. If we use recursion, then inside any instance of the function, only one for-loop is actually iterated through. So to apply this to the problem at hand, we want our function to take two parameters: the target for what number we are trying to sum to, and n - the number of positive integers we have available to use. Each function will then return (given a target and n numbers), all the combinations that will make that target - in the form of a two-dimensional list. The only special case that we must consider is the \"leaf nodes\" of our recursive tree (the cases where we have a certain target, but n == 1, so we only have one number to make the target with). This is easy to handle, we just need to remember that we should always return all combinations that make the target so in this case, there is only one \"combination\" which is the target. Then (if n > 1) the rest is self explanatory, we are simply looping through every number less than target and adding to a list of combinations (cs) with the results of calling the function again. However, before we concatenate these combos onto our list, we need to use a comprehension to add i (the next number) to the start of every combination. And that's it! Hopefully you can see how the above translates into the following code: def combos(target, n): if n == 1: return [[target]] cs = [] for i in range(0, target+1): cs += [[i]+c for c in combos(target-i, n-1)] return cs and a test (with target as 10 and n as 3 to make it clearer) shows it works: >>> combos(10, 3) [[0, 0, 10], [0, 1, 9], [0, 2, 8], [0, 3, 7], [0, 4, 6], [0, 5, 5], [0, 6, 4], [0, 7, 3], [0, 8, 2], [0, 9, 1], [0, 10, 0], [1, 0, 9], [1, 1, 8], [1, 2, 7], [1, 3, 6], [1, 4, 5], [1, 5, 4], [1, 6, 3], [1, 7, 2], [1, 8, 1], [1, 9, 0], [2, 0, 8], [2, 1, 7], [2, 2, 6], [2, 3, 5], [2, 4, 4], [2, 5, 3], [2, 6, 2], [2, 7, 1], [2, 8, 0], [3, 0, 7], [3, 1, 6], [3, 2, 5], [3, 3, 4], [3, 4, 3], [3, 5, 2], [3, 6, 1], [3, 7, 0], [4, 0, 6], [4, 1, 5], [4, 2, 4], [4, 3, 3], [4, 4, 2], [4, 5, 1], [4, 6, 0], [5, 0, 5], [5, 1, 4], [5, 2, 3], [5, 3, 2], [5, 4, 1], [5, 5, 0], [6, 0, 4], [6, 1, 3], [6, 2, 2], [6, 3, 1], [6, 4, 0], [7, 0, 3], [7, 1, 2], [7, 2, 1], [7, 3, 0], [8, 0, 2], [8, 1, 1], [8, 2, 0], [9, 0, 1], [9, 1, 0], [10, 0, 0]] Improving performance If we consider the case where we are trying to make 10 with 4 numbers. At one point, the function will be called with a target of 6 after say 1 and 3. The algorithm will as we have already explained and return the combinations using 2 numbers to make 6. However, if we now consider another case further down the line when the function is asked to give the combinations that make 6 (same as before) having been called with say 2 and 2. Notice how even though we will get the right answer (through our recursion and the for-loop), we will return the same combinations as before - when we were called with 1 and 3. Furthermore, this scenario will happen extremely often: the function will be called from different situations but be asked to give the same combinations that have already been previously calculated at a different time. This gives way to a great optimisation technique called memoization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) which essentially just means storing the results of our function as a key: value pair in a dictionary (mem) before returning. We then just check at the start of every function call if we have ever been called before with the same parameters (by seeing if the key is in the dictionary) and if it is, then we can just return the result we got last time. This speeds up the algorithm dramatically. mem = {} def combos(target, n): k = (target, n) if k in mem: return mem[k] if n == 1: return [[target]] cs = [] for i in range(0, target+1): cs += [[i]+c for c in combos(target-i, n-1)] mem[k] = cs return cs\n",

      "This is a feature of JPA called transactional write-behind. All the inserts and updates your code is executing get stored by the Jpa implementation until the transaction is flushed. This lets the jpa implementation reorder these actions to take place in whatever order makes the most sense. Flushing means executing all the actions that have been stored up so far by the entityManager instance. You can tell the entityManager to flush or it will automatically flush once the transaction boundary is reached. An example of when you would flush explicitly would be if you are inserting an entity and you need it to have an ID generated for it so you can use it later in the same method. You can always run sql within a transaction and commit or rollback later. Flushing runs the sql but doesn’t commit.\n",

      "The issue you're encountering might be related to JPA's transactional write-behind behavior and lazy flushing strategy. By default, JPA uses optimistic locking, which delays the actual database update until the transaction is committed. This means that changes made to entities within a transaction aren't immediately written to the database; instead, they're stored in memory and only applied at commit time.\n",

      "To address this, you can control the flushing behavior using EntityManager's flush() method or configure the flush mode in your persistence unit. Here are some options:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Explicitly call flush():**\n",
      "   You can manually trigger a flush operation on the EntityManager instance to ensure that any pending changes are written to the database before proceeding with subsequent operations.\n",

      "   ```java\n",
      "   entityManager.flush();\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "2. **Configure the flush mode:**\n",

      "\n",
      "   - `AUTO`: Flush occurs only when necessary, such as before a query or when explicit flush() is called.\n",

JAX-RS is used for REST.

A full JSP example is here (https://met.guc.edu.eg/onlinetutorials/jsp%20-%20servlets/a%20simple%20jsp%20example.aspx).

You are going to design a web page with UI interactions, as you said, with a button click, let say, main part under the top navigation bar is going to be generated. Go minimal, after client connected and clicks a button, your server is going to render the page. You can start by playing with the doGet/doPost methods of the HttpServlet class, here is a simple example; package com.example.Main; import java.io.IOException; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; @WebServlet(\"/mainpage\") public class SimpleServlet extends HttpServlet { @Override protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { String outputHtml = \"<html><body><h3>Hello World !</h3></body></html>\"; resp.getWriter().write(outputHtml); } } This is only an HttpServlet hello world. Easy to see that you can modify the outputHTML so you need to write additional classes to do the rendering and generating the outputs. A use of a class which takes parameters due to the user interactions and generate an HTML output will be fine (May be you can use a Builder Pattern for that).\n",
      "\n",
      "A small question with a large answer! The main thing to understand is that there is a big chunk missing from your current picture: in between the HTML and the Java, you will need a web server. And more than just a web server, a web server that knows how to run Java programs - this is called a servlet engine. Happily, there are many of these, easily available. You should get hold of either Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org/) or Jetty (http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/); both are very good (if you're going for Jetty, i would suggest version 6 rather than version 7 - long story). Once you've got your web server, you will need to give it your HTML and your Java, so it can serve the HTML to clients, and run the Java. You do this by packaging them in something called a 'web archive', or WAR, which has a particular layout, and a configuration file called web.xml. It might help you to look at a very minimal example WAR (http://mindprod.com/jgloss/warfile.html). A key thing to understand here is how the servlet engine will call your Java code. There is a standard framework for this, in which you write your code as something called a servlet. Oracle has a tutorial (http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnafd.html) about these, but it's rather dense; servlets are really much more simple than it might suggest. The example WAR i mention above has a very simple example of one, with the configuration needed to make it work. You will find the documentation for the javax.servlet.http (http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/index.html?javax/servlet/http/package-summary.html) package indispensable - that's where most of the useful API that can be used by servlets is to be found (there's also important stuff in the parent javax.servlet (http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/index.html?javax/servlet/package-summary.html) package). Having installed your servlet engine, written your servlet, and packaged it as a WAR, you will need to figure out how to start your servlet engine and feed it your WAR. There, i'm afraid i'm going to leave you to read the documentation. I think everyone does it slightly differently! Anyway, that should get you going. This is really the most basic slice through the world of Java web programming. As well as servlets, there is something called JSP you should know about. After that, there is a huge and fractious space of things called web frameworks, which aim to make writing web applications simpler. Everyone has their favourite - mine is something called Stripes (http://www.stripesframework.org/), which is very simple, but really gets things done. After that, you might also want to look at more sophisticated frameworks like JSF (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html) or Wicket (http://wicket.apache.org/), and after that, perhaps 'full-stack' frameworks like Spring (http://www.springsource.org/) or Seam (http://seamframework.org/), or other, more focused, server-side technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/ejb/index.html). Or you might well just want to stick with servlets!\n",

      "useState inside useEffect causes a re-render. In case of a re-render moduleRender = <div>Hello World</div> gets assigned to <div>Hello World</div> again and useEffect hits in. Here you can find a pretty good writing about your problem: https://medium.com/@andrewmyint/infinite-loop-inside-useeffect-react-hooks-6748de62871 (https://medium.com/@andrewmyint/infinite-loop-inside-useeffect-react-hooks-6748de62871)\n",
      "\n",
      "You should wrap the handleChange method with useCallback hooks, so that it will be created once. const handleChange = useCallback(() => setState(state + 1),[]); The infinite loop happens because you have added onChange method as dependency for useEffect in the <Comp /> component. useEffect takes array of dependencies and runs the effect if one of dependencies change. Since you have added onchange handler as dependency, each time parent component re-renders, a new instance of handleChange method is created which is not equal to the previous handlechange method. The component rendering flow will be like this: <App /> component creates handleChange method and passes it to the <Comp /> Useffect in the <Comp /> will be called after initial rendering and from there <App /> component's handleChange method will be called. state changes in <App /> component and re-renders it. While re-rendering new instance of handleChange is created and passed on onChange prop to <Comp /> component. Since the value at previous and new onChange prop is different, useEffect will fired which again will update parent component's state and this loop continues. To prevent this, handleChange method should be wrapped with useCallback. The callback function passed to useCallback hook will be memoized so when the child component compares the old and new prop they remain equal. {} === {} // false [] === [] // false (() => {}) == (() => {}) //false\n",
      "\n",
      "So first of all you must rename your custom hook to useLoadUserProfile as recommended in the React Documentation (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) so that React would be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks. The infinite loop is caused by the inclusion of the loading and error states in your dependency array. Whenever you make a call to 'setMyState' in this case setLoading or setError React reruns your custom hook again and returns updated loading or error states The useEffect hook is then run again and calls setLoading or setError which causes React to run your function again.... hence the infinite loop. So to fix this you must remove the loading and error states from your dependency array. The Rule of thumb is: if you specify the dependency array, all values from inside your component that are used by the effect must be there. Including props, state, functions — anything in your component. i.e never lie about your dependencies. In your case your useEffect hook does not even depend on your loading or error states. So they shouldn't be in the dependency array in the first place!\n",

The following statement evaluates to false for this reason: { foo: \"bar\" } === { foo: \"bar\" } Every time HookIssue is rendered, it will create a new object of { foo: \"bar\" }. This is passed to useEffect() in the dependency array, but because objects are reference types - and each object on each render will have a different reference - React will always \"see\" the query value as having changed. This means that every time asyncOperation finishes, it will cause a re-render of HookIssue, which will cause another effect to be triggered. To fix this, you need to pass a value type or a string to the dependency array instead, or you need to \"stabilize\" the query object through the use of useMemo().\n",

      "It seems like you're probably starting the \"Functional\" version of your component like this: const Rooms = (props) => { ... } Instead, why don't you destructure props like this: const Rooms = ({onFetchRooms, rooms, token}) => { ... } Now you can do this in your useEffect dependency array: useEffect(() => { onFetchRooms(token); }, [onFetchRooms, token]); This should make the infinite loop stop happening. Note: Sometimes to get rid of the \"React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'props'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.\" error, you \"can\" use: // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps For example, if you only want to add token in your dependency array and not worry about onFetchRooms, a function that will never change (i assume)\n",

Read more about how to use useEffect here (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html). Also try renaming your fetch() function to something more specific, as already mention fetch is an inbuilt js function const [state, set_state] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { async function fetchData() { const res = await axios.get(`${genUrl()}`); set_state(res.data); } fetchData(); },[genUrl()]); const fetchedData = state.results;\n",

When will the setA(false) happen? It'll occur just as it was originally scheduled to - 300-ish milliseconds after the hook originally runs. When the component re-mounts, it will not cancel or change ongoing timeouts that previous renders might have created, unless you've specifically written code to handle that possibility. The component mounts or has setA called The component (re-)renders The effect hook runs If the effect hook eventually calls setTimeout, the timeout callback will run regardless, exactly at the time scheduled, no matter what other code there is - as long as you don't call clearTimeout.

      "\n",
      "The endless loop issue in your ReactJS application when implementing React Hooks is likely due to incorrect dependency management in your `useEffect` hook. Here's a summary of the issues and solutions based on the context provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Callback Functions in Dependencies**:\n",
      "   - Wrap your callback functions with `useCallback` to memoize them and avoid creating new instances during re-renders.\n",
      "   - Example: `const handleChange = useCallback(() => setState(state + 1), []);`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dependency Array Misuse**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that only necessary dependencies are included in the dependency array of `useEffect`.\n",
      "   - Avoid adding non-dependent variables (like `loading` and `error` states) to the dependency array.\n",
      "   - Only include props, state, and functions that are actually used within the effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Object References in Dependencies**:\n",
      "   - If you pass an object to `useEffect`, React treats it as a reference type. Each render will create a new object, leading to infinite loops.\n",
      "   - Use a value type or a string for dependencies, or stabilize the object using `useMemo`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper Destructuring of Props**:\n",
      "   - Destructure props directly in your component definition (`const Rooms = ({onFetchRooms, rooms, token}) => {...}`) to ensure proper dependency tracking.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Empty Dependency Array**:\n",
      "   - If you want `useEffect` to run only once on mount, use an empty array as the dependency (`[]`).\n",
      "   - Example: `useEffect(() => { // Mount logic }, []);`\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Handling Timing Issues**:\n",
      "   - Be cautious with asynchronous operations and timeouts. Ensure that the `setTimeout` function is not recreated on each render.\n",
      "   - Use `useRef` to maintain a reference to the function across renders.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Avoiding Stale Closures**:\n",
      "   - Be aware of stale closures when working with timers. Ensure that you don't unintentionally reset or cancel timeouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Renaming Custom Hooks**:\n",
      "   - Follow the React documentation recommendation to name custom hooks appropriately (e.g., `useLoadUserProfile`) to aid in rule checking.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **ESLint Plugin**:\n",
      "   - Utilize ESLint and the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` to catch potential issues related to Hooks.\n",

      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can only have a single @return tag in a Javadoc comment. Javadoc is written for the person using your method. It should describe what the method does, not how it does it. The number of return statements in the method is compeletely irrelevant to the documentation reader, the only relevant thing is what your method returns for what inputs. In your case, you could for example document your example method as follows: /** * Logs in the user. * * @return the result of the operation if the logging in is successful, or * an error message describing the failure if it is not */ public String[] userLogIn() { ... }\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "No, it's not essential to repeat comments for the `@return` tag in Javadoc. The `@return` tag should clearly state the expected output or return value(s) of the method for each possible scenario. \n",
      "\n",
      "In your example, the description \"the result of the operation if the logging in is successful, or an error message describing the failure if it is not\" is sufficient to inform the user about the potential outputs without specifying individual return values. This approach focuses on what the method returns based on its input conditions rather than providing details on how it achieves that.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if there are specific return values that need to be distinguished (for instance, different types or formats), you might want to include them in the description for clarity. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "/**\n",
      " * Logs in the user.\n",
      " *\n",
      " * @return an array containing the user ID and a success/failure status code:\n",
      " *         - {@code [userID, 200]} if login was successful,\n",
      " *         - {@code [null, errorMessage]} if login failed\n",
      " * @throws LoginException when login fails due to invalid credentials or other issues\n",

      "    // Implementation here...\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, by explicitly mentioning the format of the returned array and including a `throws` clause, you're providing additional context that helps users understand how to handle the method's output effectively.\n",
      "\n",

      "Re: Q1, If you're creating your child processes using a multiprocessing.Pool, then no, the worker processes cannot have children. Attempting to create one will raise an exception: AssertionError: daemonic processes are not allowed to have children The reason is stated pretty clearly - the processes in a Pool are daemonic, and daemonic processes can't have children. The reason for this is that terminating the parent process will terminate its daemonic children, but the daemonic children will not be able to terminate their children, which will leave behind orphaned processes. This is stated in the documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process.daemon): Note that a daemonic process is not allowed to create child processes. Otherwise a daemonic process would leave its children orphaned if it gets terminated when its parent process exits. You can get around this by your parent processes creating a set of non-daemonic Process objects, rather than using a Pool. Then, each child can create its own multiprocessing.Pool: import multiprocessing def subf(x): print \"in subf\" def f(x): print \"in f\" p = multiprocessing.Pool(2) p.map(subf, range(2)) if __name__ == \"__main__\": processes = [] for i in range(2): proc = multiprocessing.Process(target=f, args=(i,)) proc.start() processes.append(proc) Output: in f in f in subf in subf in subf in subf This approach seems like it will work ok for you, since your initial dataset just contains four items. You can just create one Process per item in the dataset, and still have some free CPUs to spare for each sub-process to use in a small Pool. Re: Q2, it sounds like you could use itertools.product (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product) to create one large iterable of each pair of tuples you want to compare. You can then use pool.map to parallelize comparing each pair. Here's an example showing how that works: def f(x): print(x) if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Create two lists of tuples, like your use-case x = zip(range(3), range(3,6)) y = zip(range(6, 9), range(9, 12)) pool = multiprocessing.Pool() pool.map(f, itertools.product(x, y)) Output: ((0, 3), (6, 9)) ((0, 3), (7, 10)) ((0, 3), (8, 11)) ((1, 4), (6, 9)) ((1, 4), (7, 10)) ((1, 4), (8, 11)) ((2, 5), (6, 9)) ((2, 5), (8, 11)) ((2, 5), (7, 10))\n",

      "When a new child process is created, it gets a copy of the parent's address space however any subsequent changes (either by parent or child) are not reflected in the memory of the other process. They each have their own private address space. You can create a Manager() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.multiprocessing.Manager) and use its shared list (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.list) object instead: import time from multiprocessing import Manager, Process def separateProcess(start, counter): while True: time.sleep(1) print(\"length of the list from separate Process: \"+str(len(procs))) if __name__ == '__main__': m = Manager() procs = m.list() print(\"program started\") counter = 0 Process(target=separateProcess, args=(counter, counter)).start() print(\"program end\") while True: counter += 1 newstring = \"string \"+str(counter) procs.append(newstring) print(\"length of the list from main: \" + str(len(procs))) time.sleep(2) There is some overhead with this approach as it will a spawn child process to host the Manager server.

      "If you don't wan't to use a 3rd-party lib like daemonocle (https://pypi.org/project/daemonocle/) implementing a \"well-behaved\" Unix-Daemon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)), you could use subprocess.Popen() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor) to create an independent process. Another option would be to modify multiprocessing.Process to prevent auto-joining of the child when the parent exits. subprocess.Popen() With subprocess.Popen() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor) you start the new process with specifying commands and arguments like manually from terminal. This means you need to make funcs.py or another file a top-level script which parses string-arguments from stdin and then calls funcs.calculate() with these arguments. I boiled your example down to the essence so we don't have to read too much code. funcs.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 # UNIX: enable executable from terminal with: chmod +x filename import os import sys import time import psutil # 3rd party for demo def print_msg(msg): print(f\"[{time.ctime()}, pid: {os.getpid()}] --- {msg}\") def calculate(data, *args): print_msg(f\"parent pid: {psutil.Process().parent().pid}, start calculate()\") for _ in range(int(500e6)): pass print_msg(f\"parent pid: {psutil.Process().parent().pid}, end calculate()\") if __name__ == '__main__': if len(sys.argv) > 1: calculate(*sys.argv[1:]) subp_main.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 # UNIX: enable executable from terminal with: chmod +x filename if __name__ == '__main__': import time import logging import subprocess import multiprocessing as mp import funcs mp.log_to_stderr(logging.DEBUG) filename = funcs.__file__ data = (\"data\", 42) # in case filename is an executable you don't need \"python\" before `filename`: subprocess.Popen(args=[\"python\", filename, *[str(arg) for arg in data]]) time.sleep(1) # keep parent alive a bit longer for demo funcs.print_msg(f\"exiting\") And important for testing, run from terminal, e.g. not PyCharm-Run, because it won't show what the child prints. In the last line below you see the child process' parent-id changed to 1 because the child got adopted by systemd (Ubuntu) after the parent exited. $> ./subp_main.py [Fri Oct 23 20:14:44 2020, pid: 28650] --- parent pid: 28649, start calculate() [Fri Oct 23 20:14:45 2020, pid: 28649] --- exiting [INFO/MainProcess] process shutting down [DEBUG/MainProcess] running all \"atexit\" finalizers with priority >= 0 [DEBUG/MainProcess] running the remaining \"atexit\" finalizers $> [Fri Oct 23 20:14:54 2020, pid: 28650] --- parent pid: 1, end calculate() class OrphanProcess(multiprocessing.Process) If you search for something more convenient, well you can't use the high-level multiprocessing.Process as is, because it doesn't let the parent process exit before the child, as you asked for. Regular child-processes are either joined (awaited) or terminated (if you set the daemon-flag for Process) when the parent shuts down. This still happens within Python. Note that the daemon-flag doesn't make a process a Unix-Daemon. The naming is a somewhat frequent source of confusion (https://bugs.python.org/issue5906). I subclassed multiprocessing.Process to switch the auto-joining off and spend some time with the source and observing if zombies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process) might become an issue. Because the modification turns off automatic joining in the parent, I recommend using \"forkserver\" as start-method for new processes on Unix (always a good idea if the parent is already multi-threaded) to prevent zombie-children from sticking around as long the parent is still running. When the parent process terminates, its child-zombies get eventually reaped (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process) by systemd/init. Running multiprocessing.log_to_stderr() shows everything shutting down cleanly, so nothing seems broken so far. Consider this approach experimental, but it's probably a lot safer than using raw os.fork() to re-invent part of the extensive multiprocessing machinery, just to add this one feature. For error-handling in the child, write a try-except block and log to file. orphan.py import multiprocessing.util import multiprocessing.process as mpp import multiprocessing as mp __all__ = ['OrphanProcess'] class OrphanProcess(mp.Process): \"\"\"Process which won't be joined by parent on parent shutdown.\"\"\" def start(self): super().start() mpp._children.discard(self) def __del__(self): # Finalizer won't `.join()` the child because we discarded it, # so here last chance to reap a possible zombie from within Python. # Otherwise systemd/init will reap eventually. self.join(0) orph_main.py #!/usr/bin/env python3 # UNIX: enable executable from terminal with: chmod +x filename if __name__ == '__main__': import time import logging import multiprocessing as mp from orphan import OrphanProcess from funcs import print_msg, calculate mp.set_start_method(\"forkserver\") mp.log_to_stderr(logging.DEBUG) p = OrphanProcess(target=calculate, args=(\"data\", 42)) p.start() time.sleep(1) print_msg(f\"exiting\") Again test from terminal to get the child print to stdout. When the shell appears to be hanging after everything was printed over the second prompt, hit enter to get a new prompt. The parent-id stays the same here because the parent, from the OS-point of view, is the forkserver-process, not the initial main-process for orph_main.py. $> ./orph_main.py [INFO/MainProcess] created temp directory /tmp/pymp-bd75vnol [INFO/OrphanProcess-1] child process calling self.run() [Fri Oct 23 21:18:29 2020, pid: 30998] --- parent pid: 30997, start calculate() [Fri Oct 23 21:18:30 2020, pid: 30995] --- exiting [INFO/MainProcess] process shutting down [DEBUG/MainProcess] running all \"atexit\" finalizers with priority >= 0 [DEBUG/MainProcess] running the remaining \"atexit\" finalizers $> [Fri Oct 23 21:18:38 2020, pid: 30998] --- parent pid: 30997, end calculate() [INFO/OrphanProcess-1] process shutting down [DEBUG/OrphanProcess-1] running all \"atexit\" finalizers with priority >= 0 [DEBUG/OrphanProcess-1] running the remaining \"atexit\" finalizers [INFO/OrphanProcess-1] process exiting with exitcode 0\n",

      "The issue seems to be related to locating preceding sibling nodes using XPath, where Selenium is stalling indefinitely. Here are a few solutions to address this problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using CSS Selector:**\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Using JavaScript Executor:**\n",
      "   Another approach is to utilize JavaScript execution within Selenium to navigate through sibling elements. This method involves executing JavaScript code to traverse the DOM tree and find the desired sibling node:\n",
      "\n",

      "You're essentially asking how to build out an entire REST framework for a backend, which is quite a lengthy thing to answer :) I'd suggest you start by designing the structure of the JSON for all these objects. Here's a handy site that allows you to visually see the layout of the JSON: https://jsoneditoronline.org/ (https://jsoneditoronline.org/) Once you've done that for all the objects you've mentioned, here's a good tutorial on how to build basic node.js endpoints: https://medium.com/@purposenigeria/build-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-express-js-d7e59c7a3dfb (https://medium.com/@purposenigeria/build-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-express-js-d7e59c7a3dfb)\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach to consider is to keep things light and simple. If you don't have a front end, you can use the Connect module alone instead of Express, which is built on Connect: http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/ (http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) I had good luck with this approach with my Node.js RESTful API. I did end up with a few repeated patters, especially in parsing incoming post data at times. But I found the code snips were just too small to be worth putting into a module, and it offered me amazing flexibility in certain situations. One more approach that worked very well for me: Post ALL of your data as JSON - not as post key/value pairs. Depending on your API's clients, you may be able to do this. My API client was jQuery AJAX calls from a web page. It's very easy to send a JSON post. The jQuery processData property allows this as follows: $.ajax({ url: '/nodeAjaxHandler', type: 'POST', data: JSON.stringify(formVals), processData: false, dataType: 'json', success: function(data) { }, error: function(a, b, c) { } }); Now receiving the data in your Node server is as simple as waiting for the body text to load, then JSON.parse it into an object. Very readable and manageable. And when you change the data fields being posted and received, you don't need to change any of the interface code at all! (And you can go one step further if you dare, and make the field names match your database field names - then you can consolidate even more code. This felt risky to me but worked brilliantly - I'm not sure what the down sides might be yet. I do escape all my field names as well as my column names in the mySQL queries.)\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two built-in methods that you can use instead of using frameworks like axios, jQuery Ajax, ... Fetch: Using Fetch API is really simple. Just pass the URL, the path to the resource you want to fetch, to fetch() method. simple GET method: //simple GET method fetch('/js/users.json') .then(response => { // handle response data }) .catch(err => { // handle errors }); other methods like POST, DELETE,...: // some data to post const user = { first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Lilly', job_title: 'Software Engineer' }; // options of fetch const options = { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(user), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } } fetch('https://reqres.in/api/users', options) .then(response => { // handle response data }) .catch(err => { // handle errors }); XML HttpRequest: XMLHttpRequest is a built-in browser object that allows to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. Create XMLHttpRequest: let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); Initialize it, usually right after new XMLHttpRequest: xhr.open(method, URL, [async, user, password]) method – HTTP-method. Usually \"GET\" or \"POST\". URL – the URL to request, a string, can be URL object. async – if explicitly set to false, then the request is synchronous, we’ll cover that a bit later. user, password – login and password for basic HTTP auth (if required). Send it out. xhr.send([body]) This method opens the connection and sends the request to server. The optional body parameter contains the request body. Some request methods like GET do not have a body. And some of them like POST use body to send the data to the server. We’ll see examples of that later. Listen to xhr events for response. These three events are the most widely used: load – when the request is complete (even if HTTP status is like 400 or 500), and the response is fully downloaded. error – when the request couldn’t be made, e.g. network down or invalid URL. progress – triggers periodically while the response is being downloaded, reports how much has been downloaded. xhr.onload = function() { alert(`Loaded: ${xhr.status} ${xhr.response}`); }; xhr.onerror = function() { // only triggers if the request couldn't be made at all alert(`Network Error`); }; xhr.onprogress = function(event) { // triggers periodically // event.loaded - how many bytes downloaded // event.lengthComputable = true if the server sent Content-Length // header // event.total - total number of bytes (if lengthComputable) alert(`Received ${event.loaded} of ${event.total}`); };\n",
      "\n",
      "I am using axios for fetching from REST apis. You can use axios.create to create an instance that you can pass headers and the base url of your API. You could even define middlewares with axios. Using axios create (https://github.com/axios/axios): const instance = axios.create({ baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/', timeout: 1000, headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'} }); Personally, I prefer to just wrap my axios calls myself like this: function getHeaders() { return { accept: 'application/json', authorization: `Bearer ${ getStoredAuthToken() }`, }; } function postHeaders() { return { 'content-type': 'application/json', authorization: `Bearer ${ getStoredAuthToken() }`, }; } export const postRequest = ( endpoint, data ) => axios .post( API + endpoint, data, { headers: postHeaders() } ) .then( res => res.data ) .catch( ( err ) => { LoggingUtility.error( `Error in post request to entpoint ${ endpoint }`, err ); if ( isNetworkError( err ) ) { throwServerNotReachableError(); } const { status } = err.response; if ( isUnauthorizedError( status ) ) { return refreshAuthToken( () => postRequest( endpoint, data ), ); } throw err; } ); You could do something like this for every http method, e.g. deleteRequest, putRequest, postRequest etc. In React/Frontend land it is very common to do this in a folder called services which abstracts away all async fetches of data.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, Node.js is perfectly suited to making calls to external APIs. Just like everything in Node, however, the functions for making these calls are based around events, which means doing things like buffering response data as opposed to receiving a single completed response. For example: // get walking directions from central park to the empire state building var http = require(\"http\"); url = \"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Central Park&destination=Empire State Building&sensor=false&mode=walking\"; // get is a simple wrapper for request() // which sets the http method to GET var request = http.get(url, function (response) { // data is streamed in chunks from the server // so we have to handle the \"data\" event var buffer = \"\", data, route; response.on(\"data\", function (chunk) { buffer += chunk; }); response.on(\"end\", function (err) { // finished transferring data // dump the raw data console.log(buffer); console.log(\"\\n\"); data = JSON.parse(buffer); route = data.routes[0]; // extract the distance and time console.log(\"Walking Distance: \" + route.legs[0].distance.text); console.log(\"Time: \" + route.legs[0].duration.text); }); }); It may make sense to find a simple wrapper library (or write your own) if you are going to be making a lot of these calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What's the difference between Axios.js and API Rest? Do they do the same thing? A: They are two completely different thing. I see REST API as a form of standard for building your service. Whereas Axios.js is just a JavaScript library for you to make HTTP calls to an external service. What is this service? An application you build using your Node.js would typically expose 1 or more endpoints for a client (e.g. web-client) to hit to accomplish a task. Example of tasks can be like Create a User View the details of a User Modify User details Delete User What is an endpoint? It is just an URL, e.g. http://www.myservice.com/do_stuff, do_stuff would be your endpoint. What a RESTFUL web service/API means is that you would design your endpoint to be something human readable. For instance for each of the task described above, the standard states that it will be best to design the endpoints in such a way that each task would have its own endpoint that is descriptive enough to a human. Like; http://www.myservice.com/create_user http://www.myservice.com/view_user/ http://www.myservice.com/update_user/ http://www.myservice.com/delete_user/ comparing to having just one endpoint do_stuff which can just do everything. So what is Axion.js? It is simply a Javascript library which your client application can use to make HTTP call to 1 of those endpoint services described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Axios can be used to send HTTP requests like the fetch api. For installing axios use: npm install axios (assuming nodejs is installed) OR you can use the CDN: <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js\"></script> (paste this in your index.html) axios({ method: 'post', url: '/login', data: { update_id: 121631120, message: { message_id: 1, from: {like so...} } } }) .then((response) => { console.log(response); }, (error) => { console.log(error); } For more details : https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-make-http-requests-like-a-pro-with-axios/ (https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-make-http-requests-like-a-pro-with-axios/)\n",

      "Is express simply kind of a wrapper to be able to avoid that http-boilerplate code? Yes If so, to what extent should I use express and to which should I be using nodes-API? All Request and Response handling should be done via Express. Also see how Express Router simplifies things when there are a lot of urls to be served in your app Is it simply used to do the routing? Or what else is there? Yes that's pretty much it. But that's the point. Do one thing but do it good. So, when building an App with node and express how should I handle the data (users, posts, whatever,...)? Take a look at Loopback (https://loopback.io/) I am a bit confused of what the final app code should be architectured You (like myself) seem to be coming from a J2EE / Spring or Dot NET world where the various frameworks try to address the complete landscape of 2 tier or 3 tier architecture view - model - dao. Here, the landscape is little different. The frameworks are designed on the principle that do only one thing and do it good. So the overall solution becomes much tougher to arrive at. So now there are Multiple independent frameworks (node packages) available addressing the same problem space and All these components have to work together to achieve the final big-picture solution. So there are no crisp boundaries of how the stitching of these packages will be done. Its fluid. And its totally dependent on your peculiar problem. So no generic solutions here and no clear boundaries of what will end where and what will begin where. You have to decide (and that's hard work). This decision making will be a process where you evolve your architecture instead of creating it upfront in a big bang effort. It will be met with multiple failures and frustrations in initial days/months. And then read about Javascript Fatigue I'm just trying to get my mental-model straight. But you are not alone. :) Mine isn't straight either. Not many people in the industry have it straight I can assure you.\n",

      "To insert a line break between every text node within an unordered list using JavaScript, you can iterate through each `li` element, split the inner text at newline characters (`\\n`), and then reassemble the list items with line breaks.

I have to admit that I've never been fond of singletons. I much prefer a factory type approach: class Foo(object): pass def foo_singleton_factory(_singleton= Foo()): return _singleton a = foo_singleton_factory() b = foo_singleton_factory() print (a is b) This has the advantage that you can keep getting the same instance of Foo if you want it, but you're not limited to a single instance if you decide 10 years down the road that you don't want a true singleton.\n",

But to address your question, this code is outdated, passing arguments to object.__new__ will now throw an error instead of being simply ignored. To make this work, simply do not pass any arguments to __new__: In [1]: class Singleton(object): ...: _instance = None ...: def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs): ...: if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_): ...: class_._instance = object.__new__(class_) ...: return class_._instance ...: In [2]: class Test(Singleton): ...: def __init__(self, name=None): ...: print(name) ...: ...: test1 = Test('a') a Note, __init__ will be called each time you \"instantiate\" your singleton: In [3]: test2 = Test('b') b In [4]: test1 is test2 Out[4]: True Which may or may not be desirable. But seriously reconsider if you need a singleton classes. Even in languages where they sort of make sense, e.g. Java, they are often an anti-pattern, and are merely a way to hide mutable global state in an OOP-encapsulated façade. Which again, brings me to the original suggestion of just using a module, then you have no pretense.\n",

Here, _Singleton is a subclass of type. Fair enough. But as the __call__ method of _Singleton has been overriden, it will have to call the same method in its parent class to actually build an object. That is the purpose of super(_Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs): it will forward the call to the parent of _Singleton. So it is the same as: type.__call__(cls, *args, **kwargs) That is: it call the __call__ method of type but still uses cls as a self object allowing the creation a MySingleton object and bypassing a recursive call to _Singleton.__call__. Alternatives would be to use S.__new__(S, *args, **kwargs) or directly object.__new__(S), but that last one would bypass any possible object initialization. In fact, super is the Pythonic way here, because if you later build a more complex hierarchy of metaclasses (_Singleton <- _GenericMeta <- type), super(_Singleton, cls) will ensure to use the class immediately preceding _Singleton in the hierachy.\n",

      "The first issue you have is that you're using the + operator on two string values so it concatenates them. To perform addition you need to convert them to numeric values which can be done in this case by using parseFloat(). With regard to the issue of only calculating checked values, you can use the :checkbox:checked selector to only retrieve those boxes and then add up their values. In addition you need to multiply the result of that by the Quantity field in the same row. To make that easier I added a .quantity class to that input. Finally, you also need to invoke calculateTotals when the page loads in order to show the correct totals for the current form state, and also when any of the checkboxes are changed. With all that said, try this: $('table') .on('input', 'input[type=\"number\"]', () => calculateTotals()) .on('change', ':checkbox', () => calculateTotals()); calculateTotals(); $('.btn-add-row').on('click', () => { const $lastRow = $('.item:last'); const $newRow = $lastRow.clone(); $newRow.find('input').val(''); $newRow.find('td:last').text('$0.00'); $newRow.insertAfter($lastRow); $newRow.find('input:first').focus(); }); function calculateTotals() { const subtotals = $('.item').map((idx, val) => calculateSubtotal(val)).get(); const total = subtotals.reduce((a, v) => a + Number(v), 0); $('.total td:eq(1)').text(formatAsCurrency(total)); } function calculateSubtotal(row) { const $row = $(row); let subtotal = 0; let qty = parseInt($row.find('.quantity').val(), 10); $row.find(':checkbox:checked').each(function() { subtotal += (parseFloat($(this).closest('label').prev().val()) * qty) || 0; }) $row.find('td:last').text(formatAsCurrency(subtotal)); return subtotal; } function formatAsCurrency(amount) { return `$${parseFloat(amount).toFixed(2)}`; } .invoice-box { max-width: 800px; margin: auto; padding: 30px; border: 1px solid #eee; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .15); font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555; } .invoice-box table { width: 100%; line-height: inherit; text-align: left; } .invoice-box table td { padding: 5px; vertical-align: top; } .invoice-box table tr td:nth-child(n+2) { text-align: right; } .invoice-box table tr.top table td { padding-bottom: 20px; } .invoice-box table tr.top table td.title { font-size: 45px; line-height: 45px; color: #333; } .invoice-box table tr.information table td { padding-bottom: 40px; } .invoice-box table tr.heading td { background: #eee; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; font-weight: bold; } .invoice-box table tr.details td { padding-bottom: 20px; } .invoice-box table tr.item td { border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; } .invoice-box table tr.item.last td { border-bottom: none; } .invoice-box table tr.item input { padding-left: 5px; } .invoice-box table tr.item td:first-child input { margin-left: -5px; width: 100%; } .invoice-box table tr.total td:nth-child(2) { border-top: 2px solid #eee; font-weight: bold; } .invoice-box input[type=number] { width: 60px; } @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) { .invoice-box table tr.top table td { width: 100%; display: block; text-align: center; } .invoice-box table tr.information table td { width: 100%; display: block; text-align: center; } } /** RTL **/ .rtl { direction: rtl; font-family: Tahoma, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; } .rtl table { text-align: right; } .rtl table tr td:nth-child(2) { text-align: left; } <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <div class=\"invoice-box\"> <table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"> <!-- irrelevant rows removed --> <tr class=\"heading\"> <td colspan=\"3\">Payment Method</td> <td>Check #</td> </tr> <tr class=\"details\"> <td colspan=\"3\">Check</td> <td>1000</td> </tr> <tr class=\"heading\"> <td>Item</td> <td>Unit Cost</td> <td>Quantity</td> <td>Price</td> </tr> <tr class=\"item\"> <td> <input value=\"Website design\" /> </td> <td> $<input type=\"number\" value=\"10\" /> <label><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Design\"> Design</label><br> $<input type=\"number\" value=\"12\" /> <label><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Freelencer\"> Freelencer</label> </td> <td> <input type=\"number\" value=\"1\" class=\"quantity\" /> </td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"item\"> <td> <input value=\"Programmer\" /> </td> <td> $<input type=\"number\" value=\"10\" /> <label><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Design\"> Design</label><br> $<input type=\"number\" value=\"12\" /> <label><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Freelencer\"> Freelencer</label> </td> <td> <input type=\"number\" value=\"1\" class=\"quantity\" /> </td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"item\"> <td> <input value=\"Server Administrator\" /> </td> <td> $<input type=\"number\" value=\"10\" /> <label><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Design\"> Design</label><br> $<input type=\"number\" value=\"12\" /> <label><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"Freelencer\"> Freelencer</label> </td> <td> <input type=\"number\" value=\"1\" class=\"quantity\" /> </td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"> <button class=\"btn-add-row\">Add row</button> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"total\"> <td colspan=\"3\"></td> <td></td> </tr> </table> </div>\n",

      "The issue seems to stem from the fact that the `onChange` functionality isn't consistently triggering when the \"checked\" property of the checkboxes changes. To resolve this, you can move the sum calculation into a separate function and call it explicitly in the \"#allcheck\" click handler. Here's how you can modify your code:\n",

      "1. **Injecting $q Service:**\n",

As for your actually answering your question, the GitHub documentation is fairly clear that you need to send the Authorization header (http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication). Your call would actually look like this: self.headers = {'Authorization': 'token %s' % self.api_token} r = requests.post(url, headers=self.headers) Since it seems like you're using requests and a class, might I be so bold as to make a recommendation? Let's say you're doing something like making a client for the API. You might have a class like so: class GitHub(object): def __init__(self, **config_options): self.__dict__.update(**config_options) self.session = requests.Session() if hasattr(self, 'api_token'): self.session.headers['Authorization'] = 'token %s' % self.api_token elif hasattr(self, 'username') and hasattr(self, 'password'): self.session.auth = (self.username, self.password) def call_to_the_api(self, *args): # do stuff with args return self.session.post(url) The Session object will take care of the authentication for you (either by the tokens or username and password combination).

      "The 400 error you're encountering when attempting to perform field validations in Spring Boot with Thymeleaf is likely due to a missing `@Valid` annotation on your `Person` object or the lack of `BindingResult` in your controller method signature. The `@Valid` annotation tells Spring to validate the input data against the constraints defined in your `Person` class.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. Add the `@Valid` annotation above your `person` parameter in the `contactSubmit()` method:\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PrintStream is ancient. Prefer PrintWriter. Actually, it's better to use neither since both classes swallow exceptions silently. I suggest using an OutputStreamWriter wrapped by a BufferedWriter. PrintStream cannot use a character encoding other than the default charset. If you need to write strings as UTF-8 bytes and the default JVM charset is Windows-1252 (as is the case when running Java on Windows), then PrintWriter can do that, and PrintStream cannot. That's the main difference, I think. PrintWriter doesn't allow you to write a byte[], while PrintStream does. Allowing direct writing of byte[] opens up the possibility of making mistakes by mixing character encodings which shouldn't be mixed. PrintWriter allows you to write a char[] directly while PrintStream does not. PrintWriter allows you to write a slice of a String without allocating a new String.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's first have a look at the javadoc for the main differences. FileWriter (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/FileWriter.html) Convenience class for writing character files. The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding ... FileWriter is meant for writing streams of characters. PrintWriter (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html) Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. Which means FileWriter focuses on character-wise output and you cannot define the character encoding. Whereas PrintWriter focuses on formatted text output and you can specify the character encoding. Find a small example as demonstraction // we need this as there is no convenient method to output a platform // specific line separator charcater(s) String newLine = System.getProperty(\"line.separator\"); try (FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"/tmp/fw.txt\")) { fw.append('\\u2126').append(newLine); fw.write(65); fw.append(newLine); fw.append(String.format(\"%10s: %s%n\", \"some\", \"value\")); fw.append(\"some line\").append(newLine); } catch (IOException ex) { System.err.println(\"something failed: \" + ex.getMessage()); } // the println() methods will append the right platform specific line separator // charcater(s) try (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(\"/tmp/pw.txt\", \"UTF8\")) { pw.append('\\u2126'); pw.println(); pw.write(65); pw.println(); pw.printf(\"%10s: %s%n\", \"some\", \"value\"); pw.println(\"some line\"); } catch (FileNotFoundException | UnsupportedEncodingException ex) { System.err.println(ex.getMessage()); } If you run the snippet on a unicode aware machine (or run the code as java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 ...) the output will be fw.txt Ω A some: value some line pw.txt Ω A some: value some line For the above examples the code and the result look more or less the same. PrintWriter provide methods for formatted output, whereas for FileWriter you have to do the formatting before the output. But the big difference comes, when your environment is not unicode aware (or run the code as java -Dfile.encoding=ISO-8859-1 ...) fw.txt ? A some: value some line The unicode omega character cannot be printed with ISO8859-1 encoding. With the PrintWriter we defined the character encoding for the output. Which is independent from the default encoding of the environment. pw.txt Ω A some: value some line Back to your question. Wrapping a FileWriter into a PrintWriter. It is possible. But you loose the main benefit, the ability to choose the chracter encoding. try (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"/tmp/pwfw.txt\"))) { pw.append('\\u2126'); pw.println(); } catch (IOException ex) { System.err.println(\"something failed: \" + ex.getMessage()); } The file pwfw.txt will contain the unicode character omega only if the default encoding of the environment is unicode. So you would have the same limitation (for the encoding) like with FileWriter. If you have to use FileWriter or PrintWriter depends on your needs. I believe PrintWriter should to do it most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might sound flippant, but PrintStream prints to an OutputStream, and PrintWriter prints to a Writer. Ok, I doubt I'll get any points for stating the obvious. But there's more. So, what is the difference between an OutputStream and a Writer? Both are streams, with the primary difference being a OutputStream is a stream of bytes while a Writer is a stream of characters. If an OutputStream deals with bytes, what about PrintStream.print(String)? It converts chars to bytes using the default platform encoding. Using the default encoding is generally a bad thing since it can lead to bugs when moving from one platform to another, especially if you are generating the file on one platform and consuming it on another. With a Writer, you typically specify the encoding to use, avoiding any platform dependencies. Why bother having a PrintStream in the JDK, since the primary intent is to write characters, and not bytes? PrintStream predates JDK 1.1 when Reader/Writer character streams were introduced. I imagine Sun would have deprecated PrintStream if only for the fact it is so widely used. (After all, you wouldn't want each call to System.out to generate a deprecated API warning! Also, changing the type from PrintStream to PrintWriter on the standard output streams would have broken existing applications.)\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing `PrintWriter` over `PrintStream` in Java for generating text that is easy for humans to read offers several advantages, primarily related to flexibility, control, and compatibility across different platforms and environments. Here are key reasons why `PrintWriter` is often preferred:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Character Encoding Control**:\n",
      "   - `PrintWriter` explicitly allows you to specify the character encoding (e.g., \"UTF-8\"), giving you precise control over how characters are converted to bytes. This ensures consistent output regardless of the underlying system's default encoding.\n",
      "   - In contrast, `PrintStream` uses the default platform encoding, which can lead to issues if the target environment has a different default encoding. This discrepancy can cause data corruption or incorrect display, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Formatted Output**:\n",
      "   - `PrintWriter` provides methods for formatted output (`printf`, `format`), allowing you to embed variables and control string formatting easily within the output. This makes it easier to create structured and readable text.\n",
      "   - `PrintStream` lacks these formatting capabilities; formatting must be done manually before writing, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Platform Independence**:\n",
      "   - By specifying the character encoding, `PrintWriter` helps ensure that your application behaves consistently across different operating systems and environments. This is crucial for applications that need to run on various platforms without modification.\n",
      "   - `PrintStream`'s reliance on the default platform encoding can lead to unexpected behavior if the default settings differ among deployment environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Exception Handling**:\n",
      "   - While both `PrintStream` and `PrintWriter` can throw unchecked `IOException`, `PrintWriter` gives you more options for handling these exceptions gracefully, such as wrapping them in a custom exception or logging them appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Type Safety**:\n",
      "   - `PrintWriter` operates on `char` arrays or `String` objects directly, providing type safety and reducing the risk of buffer overflow or misinterpretation of data types.\n",
      "   - `PrintStream`'s methods that accept `byte` arrays can lead to confusion or errors if the developer accidentally mixes byte and character operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while `PrintStream` is simpler and historically more common, `PrintWriter` offers superior flexibility, control, and robustness for generating human-readable text, particularly in multi-platform scenarios where consistent encoding and formatted\n",

      "tshark isn't the best tool for the job. I've had good experience with libtrace (http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php) (github link (https://github.com/wanduow/libtrace)), which gives a nice toolbox for handling capture files. Specifically, in your case, the tracesplit (https://github.com/wanduow/libtrace/wiki/tracesplit) tool. Note that most of their examples are with a capture format called erf, not pcap. But they support pcap (https://github.com/wanduow/libtrace/wiki/Supported-Trace-Formats) files, you just have to specify it. The equivalent tracesplit command would be something like: tracesplit --starttime=1484908320 --endtime=1484937840 -compress-type=none pcapfile:dia5_20Jan17.pcap pcapfile:1.pcap\n",

      "There is a way to do what you want, but it means either: [Memory hog with one big pcap]: Read the existing pcap from disk with rdpcap() into a scapy PacketList() and then writing frames to the PacketList as they are received. You can selectively save intermediate PacketList to the pcap at will, but I don't think there is anything like an append capability in scapy's wrpcap(). As you mentioned, this technique also means that you are keeping the entire PacketList in memory until completion. [Glue individual pcap files together]: Only keep small snapshots of packets in memory... you should save pcap snapshots on a per-X-minute basis to disk, and then aggregate those individual files together when the script finishes. You can combine pcap files in linux with mergecap (http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/mergecap.html) from the wireshark package... The following command will combine pak1.pcap and pak2.pcap into all_paks.pcap: mergecap -w all_paks.pcap pak1.pcap pak2.pcap As for dpkt (http://code.google.com/p/dpkt/), I looked through their source, and it might be able to incrementally write packets, but I can't speak for how stable or maintained their code base is... it looks a bit neglected from the commit logs (last commit was January 9th 2011).\n",

If the data is actually encrypted (which is pretty common with HTTPS, SSH, etc.), then this is a different question. With this strategy, you may also get extraneous data from other traffic (you may need to use a display filter (https://tshark.dev/analyze/packet_hunting/packet_hunting/) on the pcap file for the traffic you're interested in so you just have the text file encapsulated with network headers for easier export).\n",

I.e., currently, the first piece of software to try would be VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org), Parallels Workstation (http://www.parallels.com/products/workstation/), or VMware Workstation (http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/overview.html), and the next piece of software to try would be some Linux distribution running on your Windows machine under the virtualization software.

Sadly, there are only 24 hours in a day, and a ton of other things to do competing for the hours that remain after such frivolities as eating and sleeping. :-)) A workaround for that particular issue would be either to save a capture from Wireshark in pcap format rather than pcap-ng format or to use Wireshark tools such as editcap (which can handle pcap-ng files on Windows, as they don't use libpcap/WinPcap to read capture files) to convert from pcap-ng to pcap.

      "overflow: auto; comes into effect when a block element contains more than its available space, that is, when its height is limited. In your example, this effects #container, which gets scrollbars because the children #left-div and #right-div takes up lots of space. When this is the case, the value of scrollHeight and clientHeight will differ, as is the case for #container. However, #left-div and #right-div do not have height limitations nor scrollbars themselves, which makes their actual height—clientHeight—to equal their scrollHeight. The fact that they are not fully visible, is because of the height limitation and overflow: auto of their parent, #container. I assumed that clientHeight is the actual visible part, but apparently this is not the case. The visible height of #left-div and #right-div is restricted by the visible height of #container, which you only get from #container.clientHeight.

      "\n",
      "The CSS property `overflow-y: scroll` introduces scrollbars when the content of an element exceeds its container's height, allowing users to scroll through the overflow content. This property doesn't inherently interfere with other functionalities unless there are specific issues related to layout, positioning, or JavaScript interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some common problems might arise due to misunderstanding or incorrect usage of `overflow-y: scroll`:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Element Sizing**: Ensure that the container element has a defined height or uses `height: 100%` if the container's parent has a defined height. Otherwise, the scrollbars might appear unexpectedly, affecting layout and appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Positioning Issues**: As mentioned, if the container's `position` is set to `relative`, absolutely positioned child elements will be positioned relative to the container, preventing them from causing overflow. Make sure the container's position is appropriate based on your layout needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JavaScript Interactions**: Be cautious with JavaScript operations involving element dimensions and scrolling behavior. Sometimes, scripts might assume elements have no scrollbars, leading to unexpected results when `overflow-y: scroll` is applied. Use event listeners or other mechanisms to account for potential scrollbar presence during runtime manipulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Layout Disruptions**: Overflow content can push elements around, potentially breaking layouts. This issue is more pronounced in responsive designs or complex layouts. Using CSS Flexbox or Grid can help manage such cases better.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Accessibility Concerns**: While scrollbars are useful for accessibility, they can sometimes cause issues if not managed properly. Ensure that focus management is handled correctly for interactive elements within the overflow area, especially those requiring keyboard navigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, `overflow-y: scroll` itself doesn't typically disrupt functionalities unless combined with specific layout or scripting issues. Careful consideration of element sizing, positioning, and interaction with JavaScript should resolve most problems encountered.\n",

First I generate a random key out of 32 randomly chosen ascii letters. Then I create an initialization vector (iv). This is necessary at the start of an encrypted file, to initialize properly. Then the cipher itself, which takes a key, an operation mode, and an initialization vector.

      "You can't generally read from and write to a file at the same time. So, you have two basic options. First, you can read into memory, then encrypt, then write back out. Hopefully you have an encrypt function that works on strings rather than files. Since you've tagged this pycrypto, and all of its engines work on strings, this should be trivial. But if you have to use files, you can usually use BytesIO (https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BytesIO) (or, for 2.x, cStringIO.StringIO), which wraps up a byte string in a file-like object, like this: def encrypt_file(path, password): temp = io.BytesIO() with open(path, 'rb') as in_file: encrypt(in_file, temp, password) with open(path, 'wb') as out_file: out_file.write(temp.getvalue()) This is dead simple, but of course it could be a problem if your files are gigantic. Or you can write to a NamedTemporaryFile (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile), then replace (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.replace) the original file with the temporary: def encrypt_file(path, password): dir = os.path.dirname(path) with open(path, 'rb') as in_file, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(dir=dir, delete=False) as out_file: encrypt(in_file, temp, password) os.replace(temp.name, path) This has some major advantages over the other method—it doesn't necessarily take a ton of memory (that depends on how encrypt is written), and there's no chance of leaving behind a partially-written file if you pull the plug (os.replace is atomic—it either happens completely, or not at all). But it's a little more complicated. And, before Python 3.3, there was no replace function. On Unix, rename works just as well. On Windows… well, that's a whole mess.\n",

      "It's a really, really, bad idea to store sensitive data in a plain-text file. You should really be decrypting the data only when you need it, and using it immediately in the program without having to write it out to a file. However, assuming that you already know this and you just want a quick-fix to hide a file, then you could: Make the file name start with a . - for example .data. This will make the file hidden on unix-based systems. Place the file in an obscure location that the user is not likely to search, such as /tmp Don't give the file an obvious name, like passwords.txt, but instead use a generated name from a hash function or timestamp - such as time.time(). This will have the added benefit of making your filename different each time the program is run. You could remove read permissions from the file with os.chmod(file, '022') Remove the file when your program closes, with os.remove(file) There are ways to get around all of these defences (even deleting a file), they only make the user's task of reading the data a little harder. This is not real protection at all, and it's definitely not a good idea to rely on techniques like this to secure real data.\n",

      "After a lot of research I believe I have an acceptable answer, however please take this with skepticism as I am NOT an expert in this field. You have been advised. This also did NOT fix the printing of the stdin problem, but i have just removed the print() function all together to remove the issue. This answer is for the password security part ONLY. tl:dr here is the answer https://alexwlchan.net/2016/11/you-should-use-keyring/ (https://alexwlchan.net/2016/11/you-should-use-keyring/) but i will explain in more detail and provide examples below of my code used to store and use passwords while never plain texting them. LONG ANSWER: Python has a package that is build for this purpose specifically called keyring(). It allows you to store and call on passwords with relative security. It works off of your login credentials so unfortunately if someone gains access to your account they will have access to this information, but without that you should theoretically be secure (or as secure as one can be i guess) Keyring() plus a package called getpass() allow for a user to input a password into their system without committing it to plain text and thus preventing accidental leaking through file sharing or the like. Here is a very simple script I wrote to automatically prompt you through your choices and store the password without ever needing to store it in plain text import keyring import getpass def main(): system = input('System:') username = input('Please input username:') keyring.set_password(system,username,getpass.getpass()) print('The password for ' +username+' in '+system+' has been set.\\nPlease do not misplace, you will not be able to recover at this point.\\nFor misplaced passwords, please resubmit new entry with the same details, it will overwrite the previous entry.') if __name__=='__main__': print('Please input the system in which the password will be used,\\nand corresponding username.') main() (if you're using Python 2 then it needs to be raw_input() ) This is done in an entirely different script so you DO NOT NEED TO HAVE THEM TOGETHER, run one script to set the password, then to call on the corresponding password is very simple in your main script from that point forward. passwd = keyring.get_password('<system you inputed>','<username you inputed>') And you're done! p.s. I personally have placed a bash file on my PATH that runs this script so that if i ever need to create a password it can be done from any directory within the machine, and thus reinforcing good security procedures.\n",

      "There's no bulletproof way to encrypt or obfuscate a Python file. Instead, your cryptosystem must simply follow Kerckhoff's principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle): A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. That is, if the would-be attacker can absolutely, fully, read and dissect your code but doesn't have access to the master key that encrypts your passwords (which presumably only you have in your head), it should still be secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Password management is always a very delicate topic, but since you are just starting and not asking about security, let's se how we can load and write a simple JSON file in a very easy way. First, lets move the actual data to a separate file, wich we can name as database.json: {\"email\": \"F7minlBDDuvMJuxESSKHFhTxFtjVB6\", \"blog\": \"VmALvQyKAxiVH5G8v01if1MLZF3sdt\", \"luggage\": \"12345\"} Then we change the application code like this: #!/usr/env python3 \"\"\" pw.py - An insecure password locker program. \"\"\" import sys import pyperclip import json import os # The path to the database file DB_FILE = \"~/Desktop/database.json\" def main(): if len(sys.argv) < 2: print('Usage: python pw.py [account] - copy account password') sys.exit() account = sys.argv[1] # first command line arg is the account name db = os.path.expanduser(DB_FILE) with open(db) as f: data = json.load(f) # Load a dictionary for disk if account in data: pyperclip.copy(data[account]) print('Password for ' + account + ' copied to clipboard.') else: print('There is no account named ' + account) print('Input the password for the said account to update the info.') new_passwd = {account: input()} # create a dictionary with the new account data data.update(new_passwd) # update the main dictionary with the new data with open(db, 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f) # convert to JSON and write to disk print('Info updated!') if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() For such a simple task, there are a number of file formats that you could use. JSON is a format that maps to Python dictionaries in a way that is both logical and easy to understand, but you could also implement it in CSV without adding much complication. But in this kind of applications, you will very soon feel the need for something more practical and robust. For instance, as your database grows, it may start to be impractical to load the whole database into memory. And it could raise even more security issues. Take your time learning the basics like these and then explore the module sqlite (https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sqlite3.html). It allows for SQL usage in a single-file relational database and will pave your way for both powerful applications and further learning.\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You should be looking at SAX parsers in Java. DOM parsers are built to read the entire XMLs, load into memory, and create java objects out of them. SAX parsers serially parse XML files and use an event based mechanism to process the data. Look at the differences here (http://howtodoinjava.com/2014/07/30/dom-vs-sax-parser-in-java/). Here's a link (http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-read-xml-file-in-java-sax-parser/) to a SAX tutorial. Hope it helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common approaches in Java are to use one of either SAX or Dom parsing libraries. If you look them up you should find loads of documentation/tutorials about them. Dom is the easiest to use normally as it stores the entire XML in memory and you cna then access any tag, however, this is less performant and can be problematic if you are using very large XML. SAX requires more work, but reads the XML and processes each tag as it gets to it. Both are able to do what you need though.\n",
      "\n",
      "DON'T, under any circumstances, try and write your own XML parser. Although on the surface XML looks straightforward, it's actually a very complex standard and you WILL miss bits of it. You might just get away with it if you are controlling the XML creation as well. But then if you are, why use XML at all? And if you're not, be prepared for the system/library/vendor that is creating it to suddenly use an advanced feature of XML that your home-built parser doesn't handle. There are plenty of open-source parsers available. There's even one built in to the JDK now. You have the choice of reading the whole document into memory in a DOM structure, or getting an event-stream (SAX). Open source libraries also allow other technologies such as XML Pull. Look at: Xerces: http://xerces.apache.org/ (http://xerces.apache.org/) - a version of this is bundled with the JDK JDOM: http://www.jdom.org/ (http://www.jdom.org/) Woodstox: http://woodstox.codehaus.org/ (http://woodstox.codehaus.org/) XMLPull: http://www.xmlpull.org/ (http://www.xmlpull.org/)\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually Java supports 4 methods to parse XML out of the box: DOM Parser/Builder: The whole XML structure is loaded into memory and you can use the well known DOM methods to work with it. DOM also allows you to write to the document with Xslt transformations. Example: public static void parse() throws ParserConfigurationException, IOException, SAXException { DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); factory.setValidating(true); factory.setIgnoringElementContentWhitespace(true); DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder(); File file = new File(\"test.xml\"); Document doc = builder.parse(file); // Do something with the document here. } SAX Parser: Solely to read a XML document. The Sax parser runs through the document and calls callback methods of the user. There are methods for start/end of a document, element and so on. They're defined in org.xml.sax.ContentHandler and there's an empty helper class DefaultHandler. public static void parse() throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException { SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance(); factory.setValidating(true); SAXParser saxParser = factory.newSAXParser(); File file = new File(\"test.xml\"); saxParser.parse(file, new ElementHandler()); // specify handler } StAx Reader/Writer: This works with a datastream oriented interface. The program asks for the next element when it's ready just like a cursor/iterator. You can also create documents with it. Read document: public static void parse() throws XMLStreamException, IOException { try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"test.xml\")) { XMLInputFactory xmlInFact = XMLInputFactory.newInstance(); XMLStreamReader reader = xmlInFact.createXMLStreamReader(fis); while(reader.hasNext()) { reader.next(); // do something here } } } Write document: public static void parse() throws XMLStreamException, IOException { try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"test.xml\")){ XMLOutputFactory xmlOutFact = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance(); XMLStreamWriter writer = xmlOutFact.createXMLStreamWriter(fos); writer.writeStartDocument(); writer.writeStartElement(\"test\"); // write stuff writer.writeEndElement(); } } JAXB: The newest implementation to read XML documents: Is part of Java 6 in v2. This allows us to serialize java objects from a document. You read the document with a class that implements a interface to javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller (you get a class for this from JAXBContext.newInstance). The context has to be initialized with the used classes, but you just have to specify the root classes and don't have to worry about static referenced classes. You use annotations to specify which classes should be elements (@XmlRootElement) and which fields are elements(@XmlElement) or attributes (@XmlAttribute, what a surprise!) public static void parse() throws JAXBException, IOException { try (FileInputStream adrFile = new FileInputStream(\"test\")) { JAXBContext ctx = JAXBContext.newInstance(RootElementClass.class); Unmarshaller um = ctx.createUnmarshaller(); RootElementClass rootElement = (RootElementClass) um.unmarshal(adrFile); } } Write document: public static void parse(RootElementClass out) throws IOException, JAXBException { try (FileOutputStream adrFile = new FileOutputStream(\"test.xml\")) { JAXBContext ctx = JAXBContext.newInstance(RootElementClass.class); Marshaller ma = ctx.createMarshaller(); ma.marshal(out, adrFile); } } Examples shamelessly copied from some old lecture slides ;-) Edit: About \"which API should I use?\". Well it depends - not all APIs have the same capabilities as you see, but if you have control over the classes you use to map the XML document JAXB is my personal favorite, really elegant and simple solution (though I haven't used it for really large documents, it could get a bit complex). SAX is pretty easy to use too and just stay away from DOM if you don't have a really good reason to use it - old, clunky API in my opinion. I don't think there are any modern 3rd party libraries that feature anything especially useful that's missing from the STL and the standard libraries have the usual advantages of being extremely well tested, documented and stable.\n",

      "I can give you not one, not two, but three directions to parse this XML (there are more but let's say they are the most commons ones): DOM -> two good resources to start : here (http://www.genedavis.com/library/xml/java_dom_xml_creation.jsp) and here (http://www.roseindia.net/xml/dom/) SAX -> quickstart from official website: here (http://www.saxproject.org/quickstart.html) StAX -> a good introduction: here (http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/07/20/introduction-to-stax.html) Judging by the size of your XML document, I'd probably go for a DOM parsing, which gonna be the easiest to implement and to use (but if you have to deal with larger files, take a look at SAX for reading-only manipulations and StAX for reading and writing ones).\n",

SAX parsers are stream parsers, these parse the XML file and essentially emit starts and ends of XML elements. It means that the file is not loaded in the memory. This makes handling of the XML more complicated in most cases, but you can work on files that do not fit into memory. Thus pick and language you like more and use SAX parser.

Here is very simple example of manipulating the data using jQuery and a button. http://jsfiddle.net/stevewilhelm/XzmQ6/2/ (http://jsfiddle.net/stevewilhelm/XzmQ6/2/) Once the data is modified, you will need to update the chart.

      "To create a stacked column chart with various data series using AmCharts, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prepare your data: Ensure that your data is structured appropriately, with each series having its own field for values (e.g., \"income\", \"expenses\", \"cumi\") and a common category axis (e.g., \"year\"). Your data should be in a format similar to this:\n",

      "Optimal methods for managing MouseClick events on a JButton\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ActionListener is what you are looking for if you want to work with buttons. JButton button = new JButton(\"SomeButton\"); button.addActionListener(this); void ActionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { if(e.getSource() == button) { // do whatever you want if button is clicked } } Or you can use anonymous inner class: button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { //do whatever you want } }); //or the Java8 version button.addActionListener((e) -> { //do whatever you want }); Whit MouseListener you can listen to events like: MouseClicked, MouseEntered, MouseExited, MousePresse, MouseReleased. You could use these, but for button click its more logical to listen to your buttons not your mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at MouseEvent#getSource (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/event/MouseEvent.html) ... although, to be honest, if you're using JButtons you shouldn't be using a MouseListener, but ActionListener instead. Also, generally speaking, most users won't double click a JButton as it's not intuitive for them to do so, buttons only need a single click to activate Remember, buttons can be activated by the keyboard as well, which MouseListener won't be notified about\n",
      "\n",
      "MouseListener is a low-level event listener in Swing (and AWT by the way). ActionListener is higher-level and should be used. Better than ActionListener though, one should use a javax.swing.Action (which is actually an ActionListener). Using an Action allows to share it among several widgets (eg JButton, JMenuItem...); not only do you share the code that is triggered when the button/menu is pushed, but also the state is shared, in particular the fact whether the action (and its associated widgets) is enabled or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, I think you need to go and read How to Use Buttons, Check Boxes, and Radio Buttons (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/button.html) and How to Write an Action Listener (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html) which will ultimately do what you want So something like... JButton btn = new JButton(\"Click me\"); btn.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"I was clicked\"); } }); will do exactly what you've just described. The fact is, most components already have some mouse and/or keyboard controls built in, so you don't \"have\" to reinvent the whole wheel over again. So I decided to create my own class myButton which extends JButton and also implements all the listeners required. But the statements for what has to be done when the button is clicked should be placed in mouseClicked normally, but using that externally I'm not getting how to use that. Yes this is what a custom interface would be used for - but the question is, is it important for the button to generate events when a \"mouse\" action occurs as to apposed to a \"key board\" action or some other action? This is why the ActionListener is generally used, as it provides an agnostic event handler for when the button is \"actioned\", generally, regardless of how it was triggered Another thing is that I want to create a method onClick inside myButton class which has the parameter of the function name same as JS. But I don't know how to create that function. Moreover function passing is not there in Java. And another problem is that how can I tell the program the onClick method is the method that should be implement when the button is clicked. There are no functions in Java, just objects. This is where an interface would be useful, it's a contract which describes what functionality an implementation is expected to provide. You've already used them, you just need to define what your expected \"trigger\"/method/callback will be for your \"onClick\" action. Ok but I want the button to listener for more events like hover, drag etc. Well drag'n'drop is handled by the Drag and Drop and Data Transfer (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/dnd/index.html) API and is, again, designed to provide an agnostic and re-usable workflow for what is, honestly, a very complicated feature. And using actionListener might be useless for that moreover I'm keeping different responses for different kinds of events . No, but you could use the ButtonModel instead, for example... btn.getModel().addChangeListener(new ChangeListener() { @Override public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) { if (btn.getModel().isRollover()) { System.out.println(\"You have entered the spiders web\"); } else { System.out.println(\"You have escaped\"); } } }); btn.setRolloverEnabled(true); (note - the JButton can also support \"roll over\" images automatically) Or if you just wanted to display a tooltip you could just use... btn.setToolTipText(\"What are you waiting for\"); And if you wanted some custom keyboard action, you could make use of the Key Bindings API (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html), for example... InputMap im = btn.getInputMap(WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW); ActionMap am = btn.getActionMap(); im.put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_M, InputEvent.ALT_DOWN_MASK), \"pressed\"); am.put(\"pressed\", new AbstractAction() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"Activiated via the keyboard\"); JButton btn = (JButton) e.getSource(); btn.doClick(); } }); I would also recommend having a look at Introduction to Event Listeners (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/intro.html). Now, if you're really hell bent on making your own button, then JButton really isn't the place to get started. You'd want to look at ButtonUI and look and feel APIs, but this is a really advance level of Swing and to be honest, not many seasoned developers get down to this level. But what about MouseWheel? Why would need to do anything other than add a MouseWheelListener to an existing instance of JButton? What \"extra\" functionality do you intend to provide which wouldn't need to be delegated to another listener? Sure, maybe you could use it as means to increase or decrease a counter I guess, but then, I'd probably only be using a seperate MouseWheelListener anyway, it's not a feature that I'd consider useful on a regular bases ... in fact, I can't say I've ever used these two together. Theres a general concept in OO, \"prefer composition over inheritance\" (https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=java+prefer+composition+over+inheritance&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), you might want to become familiar study up on it. Runnable example... import java.awt.EventQueue; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener; import java.awt.event.InputEvent; import java.awt.event.KeyEvent; import javax.swing.AbstractAction; import javax.swing.ActionMap; import javax.swing.InputMap; import javax.swing.JButton; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JPanel; import javax.swing.KeyStroke; import javax.swing.event.ChangeEvent; import javax.swing.event.ChangeListener; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { new Main(); } public Main() { EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { JFrame frame = new JFrame(); frame.add(new TestPane()); frame.pack(); frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null); frame.setVisible(true); } }); } public class TestPane extends JPanel { public TestPane() { JButton btn = new JButton(\"Click me\"); btn.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"I was clicked\"); } }); btn.getModel().addChangeListener(new ChangeListener() { @Override public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) { if (btn.getModel().isRollover()) { System.out.println(\"You have entered the spiders web\"); } else { System.out.println(\"You have escaped\"); } } }); btn.setRolloverEnabled(true); btn.setMnemonic('m'); InputMap im = btn.getInputMap(WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW); ActionMap am = btn.getActionMap(); im.put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_M, InputEvent.ALT_DOWN_MASK), \"pressed\"); am.put(\"pressed\", new AbstractAction() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"Activiated via the keyboard\"); JButton btn = (JButton) e.getSource(); btn.doClick(); } }); btn.setToolTipText(\"What are you waiting for\"); btn.addMouseWheelListener(new MouseWheelListener() { @Override public void mouseWheelMoved(MouseWheelEvent e) { System.out.println(\"I've been wheeled\"); } }); add(btn); } } } Please, understand, I'm not suggesting that you \"can't\" do all the things you're trying to do, what I'm trying to suggest is, first figure out \"how\" those things might be done already, then explore which ones do and don't work for you. From there you can start exploring alternative workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replace JButton with a custom button. Forward the events you need from the button to the button's parent. Here is an example that will forward the mouse entered event. Adjust forwarding and add exception/error handling as necessary. class JJButton extends JButton { { addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter(){ public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) { if (JJButton.this.getParent()!=null){ MouseListener[] ml = JJButton.this.getParent().getMouseListeners(); for (MouseListener l : ml) { l.mouseEntered(e); } } } }); } public JJButton(String string) { super(string); } }\n",
      "\n",
      "You should use the best tool for the job at hand. This means that for JMenuItems and for JButtons, you should use ActionListeners, not MouseListeners (exceptions notwithstanding). For instance if you disable a button, you want the button to not work, right? This works with ActionListeners but not with MouseListeners. For the best information on this type of stuff, go to the source: Swing Tutorials (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "In Java, a mouse click only registers if the mouse is pressed and released without moving the mouse at all. This is difficult for most users to accomplish, so most UI elements (like buttons) react to the mouse press and release events and ignore the \"click\". For a button, though, a better option is to add an ActionListener to it. Then the button itself will listen to the mouse events and decide when it has been clicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way you could achieve it would be something like: JLabel label = new JLabel(\"Click me\"); label.addMouseListener(new MouseListener() { public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { System.out.println(\"Clicked me!\"); } public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {} public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {} public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {} public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {} }); But, as suggested, it would be better to use a JButton here, with an ActionListener: JButton button = new JButton(\"Push me\"); button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println(\"Pushed me!\"); } });\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you're looking for an ActionListener instead of a MouseListener. You can add an actionlistener to a JButton in the same way that you add the MouseListener. button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){ public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){ //code you want to run when the button gets pressed } } The actionPerformed method will get run when the button is clicked. Here is a good tutorial for writing actionlisteners: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html) In that tutorial they do things a little different. They have a class that extends ActionListener and implements the actionPerformed method. If it is done this way then you add the whole class as the actionlistener to the button. So if your button was getting created inside the class that extends the actionlistener you would do: button.addActionListener(this); This allows you to have one actionPerformed method for multiple buttons. To tell which button gets clicked within the actionPerformed method you would call the getSource method on the ActionEvent object like so: if(e.getSource() == button) If you need more explanation on having the class extend ActionListener let me know. Edit: Definitely misunderstood what you were asking. I still recommend the actionlisteners over the way you are handling button presses with the mouselistener though. If you clarify on how you want to change the data I might be able to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "You handle mouse clicks by adding a MouseListener to your component, and this is no different for standard Swing components or custom components that extend Swing components. The mouse listener's methods must be called on the main Swing thread, the EDT (and by default this is what happens without need for special code), however the listener code can then set up and start background threads if desired.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided method using `System.setProperty(\"apple.awt.fullscreenhidecursor\", \"true\");` is indeed a viable solution for hiding the mouse pointer while running an application in full-screen exclusive mode on macOS systems. Here's a brief explanation of how this works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Setting the System Property**: The `System.setProperty()` method sets a Java system property named `\"apple.awt.fullscreenhidecursor\"` with the value `\"true\"`.\n",
      "2. **Application Full-Screen Mode**: When your application enters full-screen mode using the `setFullScreenWindow()` or `setUndecorated()` methods, the cursor will be hidden automatically if the specified system property is set to `\"true\"`.\n",
      "3. **Platform Compatibility**: Note that this method is specific to macOS platforms, as it relies on an Apple-proprietary system property. On other operating systems like Windows or Linux, you would need alternative approaches.\n",

      "You can do that with axes.set_aspect (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_aspect). For example: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt f = plt.figure() x = f.gca() x.set_aspect(\"equal\") x.plot(range(10),range(10)) plt.show()\n",

      "The problem is that using plt.axis('equal') (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.axis.html#matplotlib-pyplot-axis) is equivalent to using ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='datalim'). That adjustable='datalim' is modifying the axis limits, even if you don't want it to. Using the object-oriented approach for all of the last 3 lines of code is one way to solve this problem, since the default value of adjustable is box, not datalim. box means the shape of the axes will be changed to enforce the equal aspect ratio, compared to datalim which will keep the axes the same size, but change the axis limits. Using the state-machine version, plt.axis('equal'), doesn't allow you to set it to box, so the object-oriented approach is the best option to give you more control. Change plt.xlim(-1.5, 1.5) plt.ylim(-1.5, 1.5) plt.axis('equal') to ax.set_xlim(-1.5, 1.5) ax.set_ylim(-1.5, 1.5) ax.set_aspect('equal') (https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mv7j9.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Short Answer You're probably wanting to call: ax.imshow(..., aspect='auto') imshow will set the aspect ratio of the axes to 1 when it is called, by default. This will override any aspect you specify when you create the axes. However, this is a common source of confusion in matplotlib. Let me back up and explain what's going on in detail. Matplotlib's Layout Model aspect in matplotlib refers to the ratio of the xscale and yscale in data coordinates. It doesn't directly control the ratio of the width and height of the axes. There are three things that control the size and shape of the \"outside box\" of a matplotlib axes: The size/shape of the Figure (shown in red in figures below) The specified extent of the Axes in figure coordinates (e.g. the subplot location, shown in green in figures below) The mechanism that the Axes uses to accommodate a fixed aspect ratio (the adjustable parameter). Axes are always placed in figure coordinates in other words, their shape/size is always a ratio of the figure's shape/size. (Note: Some things such as axes_grid will change this at draw time to get around this limitation.) However, the extent the axes is given (either from its subplot location or explicitly set extent) isn't necessarily the size it will take up. Depending on the aspect and adjustable parameters, the Axes will shrink inside of its given extent. To understand how everything interacts, let's plot a circle in lots of different cases. No Fixed Aspect In the basic case (no fixed aspect ratio set for the axes), the axes will fill up the entire space allocated to it in figure coordinates (shown by the green box). The x and y scales (as set by aspect) will be free to change independently, distorting the circle: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBUah.png) When we resize the figure (interactively or at figure creation), the axes will \"squish\" with it: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ysvp.png) Fixed Aspect Ratio, adjustable='box' However, if the aspect ratio of the plot is set (imshow will force the aspect ratio to 1, by default), the Axes will adjust the size of the outside of the axes to keep the x and y data ratios at the specified aspect. A key point to understand here, though, is that the aspect of the plot is the aspect of the x and y data scales. It's not the aspect of the width and height of the plot. Therefore, if the aspect is 1, the circle will always be a circle. As an example, let's say we had done something like: fig, ax = plt.subplots() # Plot circle, etc, then: ax.set(xlim=[0, 10], ylim=[0, 20], aspect=1) By default, adjustable will be \"box\". Let's see what happens: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/XrJfx.png) The maximum space the Axes can take up is shown by the green box. However, it has to maintain the same x and y scales. There are two ways this could be accomplished: Change the x and y limits or change the shape/size of the Axes bounding box. Because the adjustable parameter of the Axes is set to the default \"box\", the Axes shrinks inside of its maximum space. And as we resize the figure, it will keep shrinking, but maintain the x and y scales by making the Axes use up less of the maximum space allocated to the axes (green box): (https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTNBu.png) Two quick side-notes: If you're using shared axes, and want to have adjustable=\"box\", use adjustable=\"box-forced\" instead. If you'd like to control where the axes is positioned inside of the \"green box\" set the anchor of the axes. E.g. ax.set_anchor('NE') to have it remain \"pinned\" to the upper right corner of the \"green box\" as it adjusts its size to maintain the aspect ratio. Fixed Aspect, adjustable=\"datalim\" The other main option for adjustable is \"datalim\". In this case, matplotlib will keep the x and y scales in data space by changing one of the axes limits. The Axes will fill up the entire space allocated to it. However, if you manually set the x or y limits, they may be overridden to allow the axes to both fill up the full space allocated to it and keep the x/y scale ratio to the specified aspect. In this case, the x limits were set to 0-10 and the y-limits to 0-20, with aspect=1, adjustable='datalim'. Note that the y-limit was not honored: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/IYRWs.png) And as we resize the figure, the aspect ratio says the same, but the data limits change (in this case, the x-limit is not honored). (https://i.stack.imgur.com/CM8xi.png) On a side note, the code to generate all of the above figures is at: https://gist.github.com/joferkington/4fe0d9164b5e4fe1e247 (https://gist.github.com/joferkington/4fe0d9164b5e4fe1e247) What does this have to do with imshow? When imshow is called, it calls ax.set_aspect(1.0), by default. Because adjustable=\"box\" by default, any plot with imshow will behave like the 3rd/4th images above. For example: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/wK8qy.png) However, if we specify imshow(..., aspect='auto'), the aspect ratio of the plot won't be overridden, and the image will \"squish\" to take up the full space allocated to the Axes: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/4mKtu.png) On the other hand, if you wanted the pixels to remain \"square\" (note: they may not be square depending on what's specified by the extent kwarg), you can leave out the aspect='auto' and set the adjustable parameter of the axes to \"datalim\" instead. E.g. ax.imshow(data, cmap='gist_earth', interpolation='none') ax.set(adjustable=\"datalim\") (https://i.stack.imgur.com/12bBD.png) Axes Shape is Controlled by Figure Shape The final part to remember is that the axes shape/size is defined as a percentage of the figure's shape/size. Therefore, if you want to preserve the aspect ratio of the axes and have a fixed spacing between adjacent subplots, you'll need to define the shape of the figure to match. plt.figaspect is extremely handy for this. It simply generates a tuple of width, height based on a specified aspect ratio or a 2D array (it will take the aspect ratio from the array's shape, not contents). For your example of a grid of subplots, each with a constant 2x1 aspect ratio, you might consider something like the following (note that I'm not using aspect=\"auto\" here, as we want the pixels in the images to remain square): import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt nrows, ncols = 8, 12 dx, dy = 1, 2 figsize = plt.figaspect(float(dy * nrows) / float(dx * ncols)) fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows, ncols, figsize=figsize) for ax in axes.flat: data = np.random.random((10*dy, 10*dx)) ax.imshow(data, interpolation='none', cmap='gray') ax.set(xticks=[], yticks=[]) pad = 0.05 # Padding around the edge of the figure xpad, ypad = dx * pad, dy * pad fig.subplots_adjust(left=xpad, right=1-xpad, top=1-ypad, bottom=ypad) plt.show() (https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONFJQ.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can set the figure size ratio with figsize=(width, height) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = [1, 2, 3] # dummy data y = [4, 5, 6] y2 = [16, 25, 36] fig , ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 2)) # <-- aspect wider than high ax2 = ax1.twinx() ax1.plot(x,y) ax2.plot(x,y2) plt.show()\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a look at the adjustable parameter of the axes. This controls whether the data limits or the bounding rectangle's shape are changed when the aspect/limits are changed. Normally, the options are \"box\" and \"datalim\", but there's a special case for shared axes. In your case, you want adjustable='box-forced'. As a quick example (I took the liberty of simplifying things slightly, feel free to use the separate set_foo methods if they're clearer to you. If you take that route, the method is ax.set_adjustable.): import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(0,1.6,50) + 50.0 fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax2 = ax.twinx() XLIM = [50.0, 51.6] YLIM = [0.0, 1.1, 0.0, 11.0] ax.plot(x,np.sin(x-50.0),'b') ax2.plot(x,np.cos(x-50.0)*10.,'r') ax.set(adjustable='box-forced', xlim=XLIM, ylim=YLIM[:2], xticks=np.arange(XLIM[0], XLIM[1], 0.2), yticks=np.arange(YLIM[0], YLIM[1]+0.1, 0.1)[:-1], aspect=(XLIM[1]-XLIM[0])/(YLIM[1]-YLIM[0])) ax2.set(adjustable='box-forced', ylim=YLIM[2:], yticks=np.arange(YLIM[2], YLIM[3]+1.0, 1.0), aspect=(XLIM[1]-XLIM[0])/(YLIM[3]-YLIM[2])) ax.grid(True, which='major',linestyle='solid') plt.show()\n",

So if you let your program run long enough, you would generate new number: 33550336. And due to slow generation of a numbers, if you let your application run for days for example, you would generate number 8589869056 and after a few more days you would generate 137438691328 and that would be it, your application would break. Reason for that is because next number would be: 2305843008139952128 and that number cannot be placed inside of a long type (your sum variable) because long can accept this range: Java Long primitive type maximum limit (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15505515/java-long-primitive-type-maximum-limit) You can add this line in your IDE: long outOfRangeNumber = 9223372036854775808L; And read the error on that line. So in theory, with your code you can only generate 7 real numbers (from 6 to 137438691328) but that generation would take days, maybe weeks even, depending on power of your machine.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided code snippets demonstrate two methods for reading the response body from an `HttpResponse` in Java, one using manual input stream handling (`readHttpResponse(CloseableHttpResponse response)`) and the other using Apache Commons' `EntityUtils` (`readHttpResponse(CloseableHttpResponse response)`). The third method uses Jsoup, a popular HTML parsing library, to achieve the same result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's compare these methods in terms of Android and desktop systems:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Manual Input Stream Handling**:\n",
      "   - In both Android and desktop environments, this approach reads the response body by creating an `InputStream` from the `HttpEntity`, wrapping it in a `BufferedReader`, and appending lines to a `StringBuilder`.\n",
      "   - However, manually managing resources like closing the `InputStream` and `response` can lead to potential issues such as resource leaks if not done correctly, especially in multithreaded or complex applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Apache Commons EntityUtils**:\n",
      "   - This method utilizes Apache Commons' `EntityUtils.toString(HttpEntity entity)`, which abstracts away the low-level details of handling input streams.\n",
      "   - It is more concise and less error-prone than the manual approach since it automatically manages resources, preventing common pitfalls like memory leaks due to forgotten closes.\n",
      "   - Both Android and desktop environments support using Apache Commons libraries, so this method will work seamlessly across platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Jsoup Library**:\n",
      "   - Jsoup simplifies HTTP communication by providing higher-level abstractions, making it easier to send requests and process responses.\n",
      "   - It internally handles resource management and provides a straightforward way to access the response body via `res.body()`.\n",
      "   - Jsoup is also platform-agnostic, working equally well on both Android and desktop systems, given that it supports the required dependencies (such as Java 8 or later).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, when comparing the behavior of `HttpResponse` between Android and desktop systems in Java, the main difference lies in the availability of libraries and their ease of use. While the underlying mechanisms remain consistent, libraries like Apache Commons and Jsoup provide more convenient and robust ways to handle HTTP responses, ensuring proper resource management and reducing the likelihood of errors.\n",

      "You cannot use Select class (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html#selenium.webdriver.support.select.Select) to operate dropdowns which are not implemented using select and option elements. You have to handle this kind of dropdown \"manually\" - generally speaking - click it to open it up, locate the desired dropdown item/option and click it. E.g., judging by you concise HTML snippet, to open up the dropdown you can try: # open up the dropdown dropdown = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\".Select-control\") # or dropdown = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\".Select-control .Select-input\") dropdown.click() # TODO: select option Sometimes, simply focusing the dropdown and typing the desired item/option text would auto-select it - if this is the case, you can try: from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains actions = ActionChains(driver) actions.move_to_element(dropdown).send_keys(\"Desired option text\").perform() And, if there are any animations or time delays (to, for example, retrieve the options from the server) you may need to add Explicit Waits (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html#explicit-waits) to handle the possible timing issues. These are all general tips, I am operating under assumptions and I have no way to check if anything above works for your use case.\n",

      "Because your dropdown is a CSS dropdown, not a HTML native dropdown(which purly composed by select and option tag), Even your dropdown also includes select and option tag, but they are invisble(you can find display: none; in its style attribute), so your dropdown is no way be controled by the invisible select and option tag. To operate CSS dropdown, you can't use the Select class which is only suite for native dropdown, you have to operate as you did manually: Click it to expand all options -> Click on option // There are two similar dropdown, only one visible dropdown_wrapper = driver .find_element_by_xpath(\"//div[@class='page_dm'][not(contains(@style, 'none'))]\"); // click wrapper to expand options to display dropdown_wrapper .find_element_by_css_selector(\"p.SelectBox\").click() // find out all options options = dropdown_wrapper .find_elements_by_css_selector(\"ul.options > li\") for index in range(1, len(options)): print(index) // click option options[index].click() // find all options again to avoid StaleElementReferenceException // because each page number change, the page content changed options = dropdown_wrapper .find_elements_by_css_selector(\"ul.options > li\")\n",

      "Since WebDriver tries to simulate real users, it cannot interact with elements which are invisible/hidden. To solve your issue, I think you would need to click on div first which will make the drop down visible and select option from the dropdown. I would recommend such an approach as opposed to pure Javascript way since it would simulate a real user. Give following a shot, WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 300); WebElement triggerDropDown = driver.findElement(By .className(\"ui-helper-hidden\")); triggerDropDown.click(); WebElement selectElement = wait.until(ExpectedConditions .visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"formLevel:levels_input\"))); Select select = new Select(selectElement); select.selectByVisibleText(\"SECURITY\"); Edit updated the class name of triggerDropDown\n",

      "Django doesn't require you to use patterns anymore, you can just make urlpatterns a list of urls urlpatterns = [url(r'^hello/', 'myapp.views.hello', name = 'hello'),]\n",

      "You forgot patterns around the second set of URL patterns. It should look like this: urlpatterns += patterns('django.contrib.auth.views',\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure why you're surprised; you removed a parameter, and things went wrong. (Your first version might well have \"worked\" when you ran the server, but I doubt you could actually get to the URL.) You are using an old version of Django. In this version, urlpatterns must be defined with the result of the patterns function. The first parameter to that function is a prefix to apply to all view strings. Your prefix is empty, but that doesn't mean you can just remove it; your first URL is now being taken as the prefix parameter. In recent versions it was recognised that this prefix is confusing and rarely used. As a result, the patterns function is removed and there is no prefix; the value of urlpatterns must now be a simple list. Additionally, views in urls must be callables, not strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to give the actual view to url(): urlpatterns = patterns('', url(r'^time/$', current_time), url(r'^what/$', what), url(r'^hello/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)', hello), ) Note that I removed the quotes around what and the other view functions. You can still use strings in the url() configurations, but then you need to use a <modulename>.<viewname> syntax or name the module in the first argument to patterns() (the string), and then you also don't need to import the functions: urlpatterns = patterns('', url(r'^time/$', 'hello_django.views.current_time'), url(r'^what/$', 'hello_django.views.what'), url(r'^hello/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)', 'hello_django.views.hello'), ) or urlpatterns = patterns('hello_django.views', url(r'^time/$', 'current_time'), url(r'^what/$', 'what'), url(r'^hello/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)', 'hello'), ) See the detailed URL dispatcher documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/urls/).\n",

In Django 1.10, urlpatterns must be a list of url() instances. Using a tuple in patterns() is not supported any more, and the Django checks framework will raise an error. Fixing this is easy, just convert any tuples urlpatterns = [ (r'^$', home, name='home'), # tuple ] to url() instances: urlpatterns = [ url(r'^$', home, name='home'), # url instance ] If you get the following NameError, NameError: name 'url' is not defined then add the following import to your urls.py: from django.conf.urls import url If you use strings in your url patterns, e.g. 'myapp.views.home', you'll have to update these to use a callable at the same time.

      "It seems like you're encountering issues with displaying forms in Django due to incorrect URL configuration. Here's how you can fix it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update your URL configuration**: In Django 1.10 and later, `urlpatterns` must be a list of `url()` instances. Remove the `patterns()` function and replace it with a direct list of `url()` instances.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from django.conf.urls import url\n",
      "from. import views\n",
      "\n",
      "urlpatterns = [\n",
      "    url(r'^$', views.FormView.as_view(), name='form'),\n",
      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use named URLs**: If you want to reference your form view elsewhere, give it a name using the `name` parameter. Then, you can reverse it using `reverse()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from django.conf.urls import url\n",
      "from. import views\n",

      "    url(r'^form/$', views.FormView.as_view(name='form'), name='form'),\n",
      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include app URLs**: If your form is inside an app, you should include its `urls.py` file in your project's main `urls.py`.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from django.conf.urls import include, url\n",

      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check your views**: Ensure your view is a valid callable that returns a response. For a form view, it should inherit from `forms.ModelFormMixin`, `forms.FormView`, or another appropriate class.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from django import forms\n",

The path separator is passed to StringUtils.tokenizeToStringArray(String, String, boolean, boolean) (https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/StringUtils.html#tokenizeToStringArray-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-boolean-boolean-) as the delimiters argument. This argument is described as \"the delimiter characters, assembled as a String (each of the characters is individually considered as a delimiter)\". In its current form, your code is telling AntPathMatcher to use \\ and t as path separators. As a result, consentreg is split into two strings: consen and reg. Perhaps you meant to use a tab character as the separator: new AntPathMatcher(\"\\t\").match(\"consentreg\", \"consentreg\"); // true\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering is due to the way `AntPathMatcher` handles path tokens. By default, it treats the dot (`.`) as a special character matching any single character and uses whitespace as delimiters to tokenize the path. When you use a custom separator like `\\`, it behaves unexpectedly because it's not recognized as a valid delimiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this, you can either:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use a tab character (`\\t`) as the separator**:\n",
      "   ```java\n",
      "   new AntPathMatcher(\"\\t\").match(\"consentreg\", \"consentreg\"); // true\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This approach works because tabs are recognized as delimiters by `AntPathMatcher`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Configure `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` to disable token trimming**:\n",
      "   You can set `setTrimTokens(false)` on your `AntPathMatcher` instance to prevent it from trimming leading and trailing whitespace from each token. However, this might not be suitable if you want to maintain the original path structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Override the default path matcher strategy**:\n",
      "   As you've discovered, you can explicitly set the `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy` property in your `application.properties` file to use `AntPathMatcher` instead of the default `PathPatternParser`:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```properties\n",
      "   spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy=ant-path-matcher\n",

You can look at this answer which is similar: Prevent redirect after form is submitted (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4038567/prevent-redirect-after-form-is-submitted) Just make your post request via js instead of a submit action of your form.\n",

The sendFile method sends a file … for the URL the client asked for. It very much does not redirect them. The send method also sends a response that isn't a redirect. What's more, a request can only have one response to it (well, unless you make use of the new features in HTTP/2 (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/guide-http2-server-push/)) redirect, sendFile, or send: Pick one (which should be redirect if you want to redirect!)\n",

      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering with `Res.redirect` in your Express application is due to the fact that redirects cannot be performed on POST requests by default, as per standard HTTP protocol rules. Redirects are designed for GET requests, as they represent a simple navigation between resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you attempt to perform a redirect on a POST request using `res.redirect()`, Express will throw an error because redirects are meant for GET requests, not POST requests. This behavior is consistent across different web frameworks and server-side languages, not just Express.js.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, you have two main options:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redirect from the client-side:** As mentioned in the context provided, you can handle the redirect on the client-side by checking for a specific message from the server after a successful POST operation. Here's an example using jQuery:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```javascript\n",
      "    $.post('/login', function(data) {\n",
      "        if (data ==='success') {\n",
      "            window.location = '/new-page'; // Perform the redirect here\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    });\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "    In your server-side code, return a specific string (e.g., \"success\") when the login is successful to trigger the client-side redirect.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use a custom solution for handling POST redirects:** If you need to maintain the original POST data after performing actions based on the POST request, consider creating a separate GET endpoint that handles the redirection. You can then call this new endpoint from your POST handler once the necessary operations are complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "    For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Server-side (Express.js):\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```javascript\n",
      "    app.post('/login', function(req, res) {\n",
      "        // Your login logic here\n",
      "\n",
      "        if (loginSuccessful) {\n",
      "            res.redirect('/new-page'); // No error now since we're using GET\n",
      "        } else {\n",
      "            res.status(401).send('Login failed!');\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    });\n",
      "\n",
      "    app.get('/new-page', function(req, res) {\n",
      "        // Handle any additional logic required before rendering the page\n",
      "        res.render('new-page');\n",
      "    });\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "    Client-side: After a successful login, you would navigate to `/new-page` manually or through a link, triggering the GET request and subsequent redirect.\n",
      "\n",

But after further investigation due to other memory leaks, I ended up with this (https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/7408) - the issue was caused by Vue Dev Tools, after disabling it everything seemed okay.

      "Boy, was I in for a ride. There were 6 memory leaks in my app. To discover them, do this: Open your Chrome devtools and focus the Memory tab (I suggest doing this in a icognito tab, so extensions don't mess with the measurements); refresh your app, and then click the little trash can (which will force a Garbage Collect - GC); Start noting the indicator of MB in the \"Select Javascript VM Instance\" (you'll probably have one line there only). You can ignore the up/down arrow indicators there, focus only on the first number, which is how many MB your tab is using right now. (https://i.stack.imgur.com/8BzKA.png) Start using your app; in your case, navigating TO and FROM the page that had the Vue app; note if the memory is going always up or if when you navigate away from the Vue app it comes down; In your case, navigating TO and FROM the app increased memory usage of 20 MB every time, eventually reaching 200MB after 10+ times or so; clicking the Garbage Collect icon only decreased usage of around 10MB, so it was obvious we head a leak. After you have put the page in this leak state and clicked the GC trash icon, select \"Heap snapshot\" in the radio options. It will collect a snapshot. Click on it. In our case, our Vue app was being kept in memory due to the leak. So we focused on the \"VueComponent\" items in the list. Click the little triangles and watch the lower part of the screen. It will start showing you what pieces of code are retaining those references in memory. Sometimes you'll get lucky and even get some line numbers there, that you can click and it will open in the sources tab. We had 6+ leaks in your app; below I'm showing one of them, and you'll see the memory trace is pointing to $notify, which was a lib (vue-notification) we were using: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/AskKf.png) Yes, you can have leaks from other people's code, that's a bummer. Looking at that lib, I could find the culprit was two event handlers defined on the created hook, that were never released; I issued a pull request here (https://github.com/euvl/vue-notification/pull/247). Rinse and repeat. Of our 6 memory leaks, most of them were easily solved when diagnosed by this method. Some stuff we had: A 'bug' in the mitt library (tiny event emitter); eventEmitter.off() should clear all event emitters, but it didn't; opened an issue here (https://github.com/developit/mitt/issues/150); We subscribed to Vuex events in created (using this.$store.subscribe()) and forgot to unsubscribe in the beforeDestroy(); the subscribe() function returns a function to unsubscribe; save it on the instance itself (like this.unsubscribeVuex = this.$store.subscribe(...)) and invoke this.unscubribeVuex in your beforeDestroy() hoook Watch out if you are not leaving window.myApp = new Vue() references around; nothing in window. gets garbage collected; good idea to set window.myApp = null; in your beforeDestroy hook; Google Chart was also causing a memory leak; I'm pasting the quick fix below, notice in the diffs how we were leaking permanent references to our vue application: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/i2pfO.png) (https://i.stack.imgur.com/BFiTE.png) (https://i.stack.imgur.com/4DlhC.png)\n",

      "The memory retention issues with text tracks in Video.js (WebVTT/VTT) can be addressed by resolving circular references and implementing proper cleanup functions. Here's a summary of the best practices and solutions provided in the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Circular References**: Avoid creating circular references in your loop function, as this may cause the autoplay functionality to fail and lead to memory leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **componentDidUnmount Function**: Implement a `componentDidUnmount` function to destroy the video when it is no longer needed. This can be done by calling `.dispose()` on the video object.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Using Timeout Instead of Interval**: Using `setTimeout` recursively instead of `setInterval` can help prevent memory leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Delete Individual Items**: When dealing with text tracks, make sure to delete individual items (`activeCues_` and `cues_`) to free up memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Debugging Memory Leaks**: Utilize Chrome DevTools' Memory tab to monitor memory usage and identify potential leaks. Force garbage collection and take heap snapshots to pinpoint problematic code segments.\n",

      "7. **Third-party Libraries**: Be aware that third-party libraries might introduce memory leaks. Diagnose these separately and reach out to maintainers for fixes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Window References**: Be cautious about global window references, as they can lead to unintended memory retention. Set `window.myApp = null;` in the `beforeDestroy` lifecycle hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Chrome Memory Usage**: Understand that Chrome may use more memory compared to other browsers for performance reasons, such as running tabs in separate processes. However, this does not indicate a problem with your code.\n",

      "The value of the yield expression (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yield-expressions) after resuming depends on the method which resumed the execution. If __next__() is used (typically via either a for or the next() builtin) then the result is None. Otherwise, if send() is used, then the result will be the value passed in to that method. So this: def f(): yield (yield 1) Is equivalent to this: def f(): x = yield 1 yield x Which in this case (since you're not using generator.send()) is equivalent to this: def f(): yield 1 yield None Your code is only looking at the first item yielded by the generator. If you instead call list() to consume the whole sequence, you'll see what I describe: def f(): yield (yield 1) def g(): yield (yield (yield 1)) print(list(f())) print(list(g())) Output: $ python3 yield.py [1, None] [1, None, None] If we iterate the generator manually (as you have), but .send() it values, then you can see that yield \"returns\" this value: gen = f() print(next(gen)) print(gen.send(42)) Output: $ python3 yield_manual.py 1 42\n",

In your version, the generator expression you assigned to y expects x to yield more values. It is easier to see that the x generator is shared with y when you use the next() function on them in turn: >>> def do_gen(): ... for i in range(3): ... yield i ... >>> def incr_gen(y): ... return y + 1 ... >>> x = do_gen() >>> y = (incr_gen(i) for i in x) >>> next(x) # first value for the range 0 >>> next(y) # second value from the range, plus 1 2 >>> next(x) # third value from the range 2 >>> next(y) # no more values available, generator done Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> StopIteration Note the StopIteration raised by next(y) as well here.\n",

      "Note: this post assumes Python 3.x syntax.† A generator (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/) is simply a function which returns an object on which you can call next, such that for every call it returns some value, until it raises a StopIteration exception, signaling that all values have been generated. Such an object is called an iterator. Normal functions return a single value using return, just like in Java. In Python, however, there is an alternative, called yield. Using yield anywhere in a function makes it a generator. Observe this code: >>> def myGen(n): ... yield n ... yield n + 1 ... >>> g = myGen(6) >>> next(g) 6 >>> next(g) 7 >>> next(g) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> StopIteration As you can see, myGen(n) is a function which yields n and n + 1. Every call to next (http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next) yields a single value, until all values have been yielded. for loops call next in the background, thus: >>> for n in myGen(6): ... print(n) ... 6 7 Likewise there are generator expressions (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/), which provide a means to succinctly describe certain common types of generators: >>> g = (n for n in range(3, 5)) >>> next(g) 3 >>> next(g) 4 >>> next(g) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> StopIteration Note that generator expressions are much like list comprehensions (http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions): >>> lc = [n for n in range(3, 5)] >>> lc [3, 4] Observe that a generator object is generated once, but its code is not run all at once. Only calls to next actually execute (part of) the code. Execution of the code in a generator stops once a yield statement has been reached, upon which it returns a value. The next call to next then causes execution to continue in the state in which the generator was left after the last yield. This is a fundamental difference with regular functions: those always start execution at the \"top\" and discard their state upon returning a value. There are more things to be said about this subject. It is e.g. possible to send data back into a generator (reference (http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yield-expressions)). But that is something I suggest you do not look into until you understand the basic concept of a generator. Now you may ask: why use generators? There are a couple of good reasons: Certain concepts can be described much more succinctly using generators. Instead of creating a function which returns a list of values, one can write a generator which generates the values on the fly. This means that no list needs to be constructed, meaning that the resulting code is more memory efficient. In this way one can even describe data streams which would simply be too large to fit in memory. Generators allow for a natural way to describe infinite streams. Consider for example the Fibonacci numbers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number): >>> def fib(): ... a, b = 0, 1 ... while True: ... yield a ... a, b = b, a + b ... >>> import itertools >>> list(itertools.islice(fib(), 10)) [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] This code uses itertools.islice (http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice) to take a finite number of elements from an infinite stream. You are advised to have a good look at the functions in the itertools (http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) module, as they are essential tools for writing advanced generators with great ease. † About Python <=2.6: in the above examples next is a function which calls the method __next__ on the given object. In Python <=2.6 one uses a slightly different technique, namely o.next() instead of next(o). Python 2.7 has next() call .next so you need not use the following in 2.7: >>> g = (n for n in range(3, 5)) >>> g.next() 3\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental issue here is that you are confusing the fact that you know when the generator will be exhausted just by looking at it, with the fact that Python can only know by running the code. When Python reaches the yield that you consider to be the last one, it does not actually know that it is the last one. What if your generator looked like this: def enumeratex(x, start=0): for elem in x: yield start, x start += 1 yield start, None Here, for reasons no one will ever know, a final None element is returned after the main generator loop. Python would have no way of knowing that the generator is done until you either Return from the generator. Raise an error, in which case everything will grind to a halt. In versions before Python 3.7, generators could raise StopIteration to indicate termination. In fact, a return statement would be equivalent to either raise StopIteration (if returning None) or raise StopIteration(return_value). So while the exact manner in which you tell Python to end the generator is up to you, you do have to be explicit about it. A yield does not by itself end the generator. TL;DR All of the code in a loop in a generator will always run, even after the last value has been yielded because Python can only know it was the last value by actually executing all the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators (any function with a yield statement) are lazy. This means that result() will not start processing until you request the first value from it, which you don't do. The root cause here is that you ask for a value from x first. This means that the generator never gets to asking it's child generator until at least the second value asked for. Consider the simpler example: def test(): yield 1 a = test() while True: yield next(a) a = test() for i in range(10): print(next(a)) This works, just as yours does. It has the potential for infinite recursion, but will only get that far if you ask for that many values. All you have to do is remove the yield 1 to get the expected behaviour. In yours, just switch N and RZ and ask for the next value - you will get the expected recursion.\n",
      "\n",
      "A generator, such as the object returned by your generator expression is a lazy iterator. It only runs as much code as it needs to provide you with the values you ask for. If you don't iterate on the generator, you don't ask for any values, so it doesn't run any code and so nothing gets printed. You can request individual values from an iterator by calling next on it: gen = (print(i) for i in range(5)) x = next(gen) # causes 0 to be printed y = next(gen) # causes 1 to be printed The first call to next asks for the first value from the generator, so it calls print with the first value from the range. The second call to next will cause the second value from the range to be printed. Both x and y will be assigned None, since that's what print returns, and so what is yielded by the generator. If you put the generator in a for loop (or pass it to a function like list that iterates over an argument), the whole generator will be consumed, just like if you called next on it a bunch of times. If you kept calling next manually, you'd eventually get a StopIteration exception, which is how an iterator signals that it has no more values to yield. The list comprehension you were trying didn't have the same behavior because unlike a generator, a list comprehension is not lazy. It runs all the code immediately, and creates a list from all the values it gets. Your list comprehension will create a list full of None values (since that's what print returns), and all the numbers will be printed as the list is being filled. Note that neither of the versions of your code are very Pythonic. You generally shouldn't use either generator expressions or list comprehensions only for their side effects (such as printing values). Use them when you care about the values being yielded (or put in the list). If you just want to print a range of numbers, just use a for loop on the range directly, and call print in the body of the loop: for i in range(5): print(i) It's acceptable list comprehension or generator expression with code that does have side effects, as long as the value being computed is also useful. For example, if you wanted to send a message to a bunch of clients over an unreliable network, you might use some code that looked something like this: results = [client.send(message) for client in clients] # client.send may return an error code for result in results: # process the results after all the messages were sent if result is not None: # no error means success print(\"client.send error:\", result) # report failures, but keep going The list comprehension on the first line is mostly being used for its side effects (sending the messages), but the list of return values is also useful, since it lets us see what errors occurred.\n",

      "To enable drag functionality for dynamically generated elements using jQuery UI, you need to ensure that the `draggable` method is called after the elements are added to the DOM. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create your dynamic elements and append them to the desired parent container.\n",
      "2. Use the `$(document).ready()` function to ensure that the DOM is fully loaded before attaching the `draggable` method to the new elements.\n",
      "3. Call the `draggable` method on the dynamically created elements within the `$(document).ready()` function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example based on the context provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "$(document).ready(function() {\n",
      "  // Create a function to generate dynamic elements\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, clicking the button with the ID `createButton` will generate a new draggable element and attach the `draggable` functionality to it. Make sure to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for jQuery and jQuery UI in your HTML file.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using a different method to create dynamic elements, adjust the code accordingly. For instance, if you're using AJAX to fetch data and dynamically insert elements into the DOM, ensure that the `draggable` method is called after the AJAX request is complete and the new elements are appended to the DOM.\n",

      "The best approach to ensure a JavaScript function for scrolling within a parent element without surpassing its lower boundary involves a combination of methods. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use `scrollIntoView`**: This method allows you to smoothly scroll to a specific element. To prevent surpassing the lower boundary, set the second parameter to `true`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   const element = document.getElementById('targetElement');\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check the scroll position and height**: Before triggering the scroll, check if the current scroll position is close to the bottom. You can calculate the total scrollable area and compare it with the current scroll position.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   const box = document.getElementById('box');\n",
      "   const scrollTop = box.scrollTop;\n",

      "     box.scrollTop += 10; // Incremental scrolling\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prevent default scrolling**: To avoid any unwanted scrolling caused by other events or user interactions, you can bind a scroll event listener and call `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`.\n",

      "   }, false);\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "As given in the documentation - (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html) numpy.transpose(a, axes=None) axes : list of ints, optional By default, reverse the dimensions, otherwise permute the axes according to the values given. The second argument is the axes using which the values are permuted. That is for example if the index of initial element is (x,y,z) (where x is 0th axes, y is 1st axes, and z is 2nd axes) , the position of that element in the resulting array becomes (z,y,x) (that is 2nd axes first, then 1st axes, and last 0th axes) , based on the argument you provided for axes . Since you are transposing an array of shape (2,2,2) , the transposed shape is also (2,2,2) , and the positions would change as - (0,0,0) -> (0,0,0) (1,0,0) -> (0,0,1) (0,1,0) -> (0,1,0) (1,1,0) -> (0,1,1) ... Since the axes you choose are trivial, lets explain this for another axes. Example - In [54]: A = np.arange(30).reshape((2, 3, 5)) In [55]: A Out[55]: array([[[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]], [[15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [20, 21, 22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]]]) In [56]: np.transpose(A,(1,2,0)) Out[56]: array([[[ 0, 15], [ 1, 16], [ 2, 17], [ 3, 18], [ 4, 19]], [[ 5, 20], [ 6, 21], [ 7, 22], [ 8, 23], [ 9, 24]], [[10, 25], [11, 26], [12, 27], [13, 28], [14, 29]]]) Here, the first element (0,0,0) becomes the (0,0,0) element in the result. The second element (0,0,1) becomes the (0,1,0) element in the result. And so on - (0,0,0) -> (0,0,0) (0,0,1) -> (0,1,0) (0,0,2) -> (0,2,0) ... (2,3,4) -> (3,4,2) ...\n",

      "The `numpy.transpose()` function is used to rearrange the dimensions of a multi-dimensional array. It takes two arguments: the input array `a` and an optional parameter `axes`. If no `axes` argument is provided, it defaults to reversing the order of the dimensions. If `axes` is specified, it should be a sequence of integers representing the desired new axis order.\n",

      "In the context of a 3D array like `A`, which has dimensions `(2, 3, 5)`, transposing with `np.transpose(A, (1, 2, 0))` means moving the third dimension (index 2) to the first position, the second dimension (index 1) to the second position, and the first dimension (index 0) to the third position.

Your calculation of the regression line is correct, what needs to be fixed is how to plot that line over your data set: After fitting your data, you need to extract the values necessary to draw the regression line; the data you need are two points at each extremities of the x-axis (here, x=0 and x=25). if we call model.predict on these two values, we obtain the corresponding predictions. These x values coupled with their corresponding predictions form two points that we will use to plot the line. First we extract the predicted values y0 and y25.

The specific line mentioned is `Activity.java:1884`, where `getWindow()` is returning `null`. This indicates that the activity is not considered \"visual,\" possibly because it's been declared as a service.\n",

      "Additionally, if you're using an `ImageButton` instead of a regular `Button`, you'll need to update the corresponding code to handle the `ImageButton` appropriately. Alternatively, you can modify the button's click listener to handle the image button's click event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, always ensure that you call `findViewById()` from the appropriate context (either an Activity or a Fragment) and that the views you're searching for actually exist in the layout file. In the given example, the button with ID `buttonDone` was not found, causing the NPE when attempting to set an onClickListener.

A membership check of a list, runs in linear time. Since there are an exponential number of combinations, this means that it will start running in O((n!)2) time, with n the number of elements, which is typically very slow. A faster way to do this, is using a set concurrently, that stores the elements, and then each time check membership of the tuple (a set can not contain lists, since lists are unhashable), in case the membership fails, we add it to b as a list: from itertools import combinations a=[10, 1 ,2, 7, 6, 1, 5] b=[] seen = set() for i in range(len(a)): for s in combinations(a,i): if s not in seen: seen.add(s) b.append(list(s)) print(b)\n",

Obviously for drawing, it wants a tuple with length 2 (namely, the x and y coordinates). Hence the error; the inner function expects two arguments but only one value was inside your tuple.

Either way you only have two values in the pt1 or pt2 arrays, so reshaping won't affect it. For e.g. you could use flatten() from numpy: >>> tuple(pt1.flatten()) (50, 50) And this should fix your issue. >>> pt1 = np.array([[50, 50]]) >>> cv2.circle(img, tuple(pt1.flatten()), 5, 255, -1) >>>\n",

Notice that you use the X and Y coordinates of the point you want to process (represented by right_pt and y_center respectively) in the same order to do both of the following: index a numpy array: canvas[right_pt,y_center] specify point coordinate to an OpenCV function: (right_pt,y_center) That is a problem, because each of those libraries expects a different order: numpy indexing is by default row-major, i.e. img[y,x] points and sizes in OpenCV are column-major, i.e. (x,y) In this particular case, the error is in the order of indexes for the numpy array canvas. To fix it, just switch them around: while(np.any(canvas[y_center,right_pt] != [0,255,0])): cv2.circle(canvas,(right_pt,y_center),1,(255,255,255),1) right_pt += 1 # ditto for the second loop Once you fix that, and run your script, it will crash with an error like while(np.any(canvas[y_center,right_pt] != [0,255,0])): IndexError: index 1200 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1200 Why didn't this happen before? Since the centroid was (654, 664) and you had the coordinates swapped, you were looking 10 rows away from where you were drawing. The problem lies in the fact that you're drawing white circles into the same image you're also searching for green pixels, combined with perhaps mistaken interpretation of what the radius parameter of cv2.circle does. I suppose the best way to show this with an image (representing 5 rows of 13 pixels): (https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBmD2.png) The red dots are centers of respective circles, white squares are the pixels drawn, black squares are the pixels left untouched and the yellow arrows indicate the direction of iteration along the row. On the left side, you can see circle with radius 1, on the right radius 0. Let's say we're approaching the green area we want to detect: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/jtApm.png) And make another iteration: (https://i.stack.imgur.com/6gJIl.png) Oops, with radius of 1, we just changed the green pixel we're looking for to white. Hence we can never find any green pixels (with the exception of the first point tested, since at that point we haven't drawn anything yet, and only in the first loop), and the loop will run out of bounds of the image. There are several options on how to resolve this problem. The simplest one, if you're fine with a thinner line, is to change the radius to 0 in both calls to cv2.circle. Another possibility would be to cache a copy of \"the row of interest\", so that any drawing you do on canvas won't effect the search: target_row = canvas[y_center].copy() while(np.any(target_row[right_pt] != [0,255,0])): cv2.circle(canvas,(right_pt,y_center),1,(255,255,255),1) right_pt += 1 or target_row = canvas[y_center] != [0,255,0] while(np.any(target_row[right_pt])): cv2.circle(canvas,(right_pt,y_center),1,(255,255,255),1) right_pt += 1 or even better target_row = np.any(canvas[y_center] != [0,255,0], axis=1) while(target_row[right_pt]): cv2.circle(canvas,(right_pt,y_center),1,(255,255,255),1) right_pt += 1 Finally, you could skip the drawing in the loops, and just use a single function call to draw a line connecting the two endpoints you found. target_row = np.any(canvas[y_center] != [0,255,0], axis=1) while(target_row[right_pt]): right_pt += 1 while(target_row[left_pt]): left_pt -= 1 #Drawing the obtained points cv2.line(canvas, (left_pt,y_center), (right_pt,y_center), (255,255,255), 2) cv2.circle(canvas, (right_pt,y_center), 1, (0, 255, 0), 2) cv2.circle(canvas, (left_pt,y_center), 1, (0, 255, 0), 2) Bonus: Let's get rid of the explicit loops. left_pt, right_pt = np.where(np.all(canvas[y_center] == [0,255,0], axis=1))[0] This will (obviously) work only if there are two matching pixels on the row of interest. However, it is trivial to extend this to find the first one from the ellipses center in each direction (you get an array of all X coordinates/columns that contain a green pixel for that row). Cropped output (generated by cv2.imshow) of that implementation can be seen in the following image (the centroid is blue, since you used (255,0,0) to draw it, and OpenCV uses BGR order by default): (https://i.stack.imgur.com/KXpG2.png)\n",

Ensure that every variable is of type np.float32, then run the function. However I am skeptical that you will obtain decent results with just one perspective. You usually need more if you are calibrating a camera subject to large distortion. Nevertheless, the above is what you need to get the method working.\n",

      "This is because your numpy array is not made up of the right data type. By default makes an array of type np.int64 (64 bit), however, cv2.cvtColor() requires 8 bit (np.uint8) or 16 bit (np.uint16). To correct this change your np.full() function to include the data type: img = np.full((100,80,3), 12, np.uint8)\n",

      "The actual error comes from the tuple() (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tuple-function/) function which expects an iterable. Since you're passing a single value i[0], this function call fails with the given error message. At this point, it doesn't matter, whether circles has proper values or is just None. So, the first step is, as also stated in Gulzar's answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/65337940/11089932), to check whether circles is None. But, this doesn't solve the actual error coming from the tuple() call. Therefore, check the OpenCV documentation on circle (https://docs.opencv.org/4.4.0/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html#gaf10604b069374903dbd0f0488cb43670): The center needs to be a tuple of two int values, and radius a single int value. So, just get rid of the tuple() calls and set up the tuple manually: if circles is not None: for i in circles[0, :]: cv2.circle(roi_color2, (int(i[0]), int(i[1])), int(i[2]), (255,255,255), 1) ---------------------------------------- System information ---------------------------------------- Platform: Windows-10-10.0.16299-SP0 Python: 3.8.5 OpenCV: 4.4.0 ----------------------------------------\n",

You can create it without using an OpenCV function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documentation is not always explicit about the input shape in Python unfortunately, and undistortPoints() doesn't even have Python documentation yet. The input points need to be an array with the shape (n_points, 1, n_dimensions). So if you have 2D coordinates, they should be in the shape (n_points, 1, 2). Or for 3D coordinates they should be in the shape (n_points, 1, 3). This is true for most OpenCV functions. AFAIK, this format will work for all OpenCV functions, while some few OpenCV functions will also accept points in the shape (n_points, n_dimensions). I find it best to just keep everything consistent and in the format (n_points, 1, n_dimensions). To be clear this means an array of four 32-bit float 2D points would look like: points = np.array([[[x1, y1]], [[x2, y2]], [[x3, y3]], [[x4, y4]]], dtype=np.float32) If you have an array that has the shape (n_points, n_dimensions) you can expand it with np.newaxis: >>> points = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]) >>> points.shape (4, 2) >>> points = points[:, np.newaxis, :] >>> points.shape (4, 1, 2) or with np.expand_dims(): >>> points = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]) >>> points.shape (4, 2) >>> points = np.expand_dims(points, 1) >>> points.shape (4, 1, 2) or with various orderings of np.transpose() depending on the order of your dimensions. For e.g. if your shape is (1, n_points, n_dimensions) then you want to swap axis 0 with axis 1 to get (n_points, 1, n_dimensions), so points = np.transpose(points, (1, 0, 2)) would change the axes to put axis 1 first, then axis 0, then axis 2, so the new shape would be correct. If you think this is an odd format for points, it is if you only consider a list of points, but reasonable if you think about points as coordinates of an image. If you have an image, then the coordinates of each point in the image is defined by an (x, y) pair, like: (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) ... (0, 1) (1, 1) (2, 1) ... (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 2) ... ... Here it makes sense to put each coordinate into a separate channel of a two-channel array, so that you get one 2D array of x-coordinates, and one 2D array of y-coordinates, like: Channel 0 (x-coordinates): 0 1 2 ... 0 1 2 ... 0 1 2 ... ... Channel 1 (y-coordinates): 0 0 0 ... 1 1 1 ... 2 2 2 ... ... So that's the reason for having each coordinate on a separate channel. Some other OpenCV functions which require this format include cv2.transform() and cv2.perspectiveTransform(), which I've answered identical questions about before, here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/44387123/5087436) and here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45818765/5087436) respectively.\n",

      "Reproduced your error. The error message is pretty confusing in this version of OpenCV (4.2.0).

The problem is that after you call img = img.transpose((2,0,1)) img = img.reshape(1,3,300,300) img cannot be interpreted as an image by OpenCV. The issue can be solved, for example, this way: 1. Copy img before the transformation to another variable imgForDisplaying 2. Use imgForDisplaying to draw rectangle. img = r'D:\\SriSailam.jpg' img = cv2.imread(img) img = cv2.resize(img,(300,300)) imgToDisplay = img img = img.transpose((2,0,1)) img = img.reshape(1,3,300,300) ... rect = cv2.rectangle(imgToDisplay, (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax), (0, 0, 255), 1)\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding \"performance\": that might really depend on the JVM version; in other words: depending on the implementation of replace() changes, having that if in place can save you some regex-matcher cost; or not. Regarding the second question: basically you have a lot of duplicated code there. One way to work on that: You could define some static final field, like: Map<String, String> replacements = new HashMap<>(); To then fill with: replacements.put(\"â\", \"a\"); ... To then replace the current code with a loop that iterates the entries of that map, using each key/value as argument to a replace() call. Or, as shown by the other answer, you do something like replacements.put(\"[áàâä]\", \"a\"); to then use replaceAll() later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "String.replace() (http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Core/lang/java/lang/String.java.htm) uses regex underneath. public String replace(CharSequence target, CharSequence replacement) { return Pattern.compile(target.toString(), Pattern.LITERAL) .matcher(this ).replaceAll( Matcher.quoteReplacement(replacement.toString())); } Are there more efficient ways than the above described two? There are given that you operate on an implementation backed e.g., by an array, rather than the immutable String class (since string.replace creates a new string on each invocation). See for instance StringBuilder.replace() (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html). Compiling a regex incurs quite alot of overhead which is clear when observing the Pattern source code (http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Core/Collections-Jar-Zip-Logging-regex/java/util/regex/Pattern.java.htm). Luckily, Apache offers an alternative approach in StringUtils.replace() (http://commons.apache.org/lang/api-2.3/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html) which according to the source code (http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.java.html) (line #3732) is quite efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't have to use regular expressions, it is always preferred to use String.replace() (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replace%28java.lang.CharSequence,%20java.lang.CharSequence%29) instead of String.replaceAll(), since you get rid of all the regular expression overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless a more in-depth benchmark or profiling is done on this code, it's hard to impute this low performance solely to the Regex implementation (although I tend to -speculatively- agree with you...). So, I tried this exact code, it took 14 seconds to run on my machine. I tried to run it in parallel, and this reduced it from 14 to 3 seconds: IntStream.iterate(0, i -> i+1).limit(50000).parallel().forEach((i) -> { Matcher mat = p.matcher(s); StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); while (mat.find()) { String repString = m.get(mat.group(1)); if (repString != null) { mat.appendReplacement(sb, repString); } } mat.appendTail(sb); }); Now, I suppose that your exact problem isn't particularly linked to the fact that code is running sequentially or not (it's unlikely that your real-world application will do this 50000 find/replace exercise on a single string), but this at least leads to other aspects not mentioned in your question (or even not considered at all). Otherwise, it also tells you that if this is something used this intensively, you'd better run it in parallel. In other words, this answers the \"How can I optimize the performance of this\" question... You'd probably have to compare the results of single executions with as little as possible involvement of other classes to minimize the effect of other factors, but comparing performance across languages will surely remain challenging. An alternative you could consider is Groovy's template engine, which performs better than both (assuming the template is reused - which is very possible to do). This is particularly good in your case, because you wouldn't need to change the placeholders in your template text. Map<String, String> binding = new HashMap<>(); binding.put(\"TO\", \"rcpt\"); binding.put(\"MESSAGE_ID\", \"37\"); binding.put(\"ID\", \"40\"); binding.put(\"UNIQID\", \"cff47534-fe6b-c45a-7058-8301adf1b97\"); binding.put(\"XO\", \"abcdef\"); binding.put(\"XOR\", \"abcdef\"); String text = s; groovy.text.SimpleTemplateEngine engine = new groovy.text.SimpleTemplateEngine(); Template template = engine.createTemplate(text); for (int i = 0; i < 50000; i++) { template.make(binding).toString(); } long timeTaken = System.currentTimeMillis() - start; System.out.println(\"Time taken in ms = \"+ timeTaken); } The above Groovy version completes in 3.182 seconds; while its parallel version (same stream mechanism) completes in 2.313 seconds You can find out more about groovy templates here (http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/documentation/template-engines.html)\n",

      "When developing a Regex pattern in Java to utilize with `String.replaceAll()`, consider the following tips for optimal performance and maintainability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Avoid overuse of capturing groups**: Capturing groups (`()`) are useful for extracting parts of the matched pattern, but they add complexity and decrease performance. Use non-capturing groups (`(?:...)`) when possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use character classes efficiently**: Character classes (`[]` or `[^...]`) can match any character within the brackets. Be mindful of the order of characters within the class, as the first character has higher precedence. For example, `[ab]` matches either 'a' or 'b', whereas `[ba]` matches 'b' followed by 'a'.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use quantifiers wisely**: Quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{}`) specify how many occurrences of a preceding element are required. Use the minimum necessary to match your desired patterns. Overusing quantifiers can lead to slower performance due to backtracking.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use greedy vs. reluctant matching**: Greedy quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `*?`, `+?`) match as much of the input as possible. Reluctant quantifiers (`*?`, `+?`) match as few characters as needed. Choose the appropriate matching behavior based on your requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Compile patterns once and reuse them**: If you're performing multiple replacements with the same pattern, compile the pattern using `Pattern.compile()` beforehand and reuse it with `Matcher.matches()` or `Matcher.find()`. Avoid compiling patterns inside loops whenever possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consider using alternatives**: If you're dealing with a large number of replacements, consider using alternatives such as `StringUtils.replaceEach()` from Apache Commons Lang, which may offer better performance than `String.replaceAll()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Profile and optimize**: Benchmark different approaches to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. Consider factors such as memory usage, CPU utilization, and overall program performance when evaluating alternatives.\n",

      "Since you seem to use react-native, you can render multiple components like this: const showArrayOfObject=() =>{ return( <View> <Text style={styles.sectionDescription}> {example.map((element) => <div key={element.toString()}>{'\\nID: '+ element.iD + '\\nType: ' + element.tP + '\\ncolor:'+ element.color}</div> )} </Text> </View> ); } This way, you are mapping every element of your array into an HTML element that will be rendered in the DOM. If you want to know more about this, you can check the official React documentation here: https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#rendering-multiple-components (https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#rendering-multiple-components)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can achieve this quite easily. In this example I am rendering a component dynamically based on a prop: class MyComponent extends React.Component { propTypes: { display: React.PropTypes.bool }, render() { return ( <div> {this.props.display ? <ChildComponent /> : null} </div> ) } } In your case you may want to use internal component state to mount or unmount the component. FYI there are cases where you might prefer or need to use style to hide components instead of destroying them. There is more about this in the React documenation. See the 'Stateful Children' section here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "All components in the end are functions or classes that you can get a reference to and therefore access dynamically through any object. JSX is simply a unique syntax to call that function. So first get a reference to the React component and then use JSX to render the component. Solution Code: import React, { useState } from \"react\"; import { ComponentOne, ComponentTwo, ComponentThree } from \"../directory\"; const map = { k1: { name: \"Component 1\", child: ComponentOne }, k2: { name: \"Component 2\", child: ComponentTwo }, k3: { name: \"Component 3\", child: ComponentThree }, }; const myComponent = () => { const [active, setActive] = useState(\"k1\"); // Store the reference to the component you want to render in a variable const ActiveChild = map[active].child; return ( <React.Fragment> <div> {Object.entries(map).map(([k, v]) => ( <h1 onClick={() => setActive(k)}>{v.name}</h1> ))} </div> <div> {/* Since the variable holds reference to a React component, you can render it JSX syntax */} <ActiveChild /> </div> </React.Fragment> ); };\n",

      "OP here, I figured it out and wanted to leave the answer here for future readers. First you have to create a const object of all imported components that you want to dynamically render. This has to be outside of the main component block. const characters = { Larry, Jane, Reginald, Amy, }; Then inside your main component, you create a const for your target import by referencing the array you created earlier. const FactoryOutput = characters[props.character]; And finally you can write a single block of code which will dynamically render the imported component based on a prop value. No more switch/case statements. <FactoryOutput top={props.top} bottom={props.bottom} shoes={props.shoes} /> Here's the original code modified with the solution: import React, {} from 'react'; import { View, } from \"react-native\"; // My custom components import Larry from './characters/larry'; import Jane from './characters/jane'; import Reginald from './characters/reginald'; import Amy from './characters/amy'; const characters = { Larry, Jane, Reginald, Amy, }; const CharacterFactory = (props) => { const FactoryOutput = characters[props.character]; return ( <FactoryOutput top={props.top} bottom={props.bottom} shoes={props.shoes} /> ); } export default CharacterFactory;\n",

      "I suggest you taking a look at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/sectionlist.html (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/sectionlist.html), which fits your need for a section based data set nicely. <SectionList renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item.title} />} // Your record component here. renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <H1 title={section.title} />} // Your date component here. sections={[ // homogenous rendering between sections {data: [...], title: ...}, {data: [...], title: ...}, {data: [...], title: ...}, ]} /> The above works nicely if your list rows in your sections are very similar. You can also have different component for different sections by passing in a per-section renderItem method: <SectionList sections={[ // heterogeneous rendering between sections {data: [...], title: ..., renderItem: ...}, {data: [...], title: ..., renderItem: ...}, {data: [...], title: ..., renderItem: ...}, ]} /> Also, the warning about Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique \"key\" prop. is because you are essentially returning an array of similar data, and React wants you to pass an key prop to help it better identify the components when rendering and re-rendering. You should pass in a key prop as the root of your repeating components like this <View style={{ height: 40, flexDirection: 'row' }} key={key}>\n",

      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a look at the definition of Pool.map(): def map(self, func, iterable, chunksize=None): From the view of semantics, the method Pool.map() just applies the function to an iterable, namely, the function must have and only have one variable argument which gets a value from the iterable. So the function must have only one argument or have a variable argument with other arguments having fixed values. So there are a few solutions: Use functools.partial() function to fix other arguments in the function, which is described in Python multiprocessing pool.map for multiple arguments (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5442910/python-multiprocessing-pool-map-for-multiple-arguments) Use a list or tuple as the unique argument of the function, which encapsulates the arguments the function needs Don't use Pool.map(). Use multiprocessing.Process() to generate each process and then add them to the pool\n",
      "\n",
      "It works that way because you are not defining explicitly \"chunksize\" in pool.map: map(func, iterable[, chunksize]) This method chops the iterable into a number of chunks which it submits to the process pool as separate tasks. The (approximate) size of these chunks can be specified by setting chunksize to a positive integer Source: https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool (https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool) For 8 items, considering a len(pool)=2, chunksize will be 1 ( divmod(8,2*4)) so you see (8/1)/2 workers = 4 workers workers = (len of items / chunksize) / tasks per process For 20 items, considering a len(pool)=2, chunksize will be 3 (divmode(20,2*4)) so you see something like (20/3)/2 = 3.3 workers For 40...chunksize=5, workers= (40/5)/5 = 4 workers If you want, you can set chunksize=1 res = pool.map(ret_x, range(40), 1) And you will see (20/1)/2 = 10 workers python mppp.py made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker! made a worker!

      "Answer: \n",
      "The `chunksize` parameter in `Pool.map()` does matter when using multiprocessing with `pool.map()` in Python. It determines how many items from the input iterable are passed to each worker process before they start processing a new batch. \n",
      "\n",
      "A larger `chunksize` can improve performance by reducing the overhead of creating new processes and passing data between them. However, if the `chunksize` is too large, it might lead to increased memory usage and decreased responsiveness due to the delay in starting new tasks. Conversely, a smaller `chunksize` can result in more frequent process creation and communication overhead but may provide better responsiveness and lower memory usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the optimal `chunksize`, consider factors such as the size of your input data, the complexity of the task, and available system resources. Experimentation and profiling are often necessary to find the best balance for your specific use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example demonstrating the effect of different `chunksize` values on a simple computation:\n",

      "import multiprocessing\n",

      "\n",
      "def square(n):\n",

Error message is very specific about that. In your case, if you want to create new model for a new truck everytime, you may need to override the save() method of your ModelForm for appropriate reasons. Or else if you want to choose a model from existing MODELs, either you could let Django use the default select widget for the field or you can override that too by defining a custom widget. MODEL = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=MODEL.objects.all()) #something like this.\n",

The error you got means you provided wrong information that doesn't match any id in another model(Person in your case). What you can do is: not using ModelForm but Form. You might have some extra work to do after you call form.is_valid(), but at least you could code up your logic however you want.\n",

So assuming your aim is to allow the user to enter an ID directly, all you need to do is to change the widget of the project field: class ProductForm(ModelForm): name = CharField( max_length=255, widget=TextInput({'class': 'form-control mb-2', 'placeholder': 'Product Name'}), label=_(\"Product Name\"), required=True) project = ModelChoiceField( model=Project, widget=NumberInput({'class': 'form-control mb-2', 'readonly': 'readonly'}), required=True, label=_(\"Parent Project\")) class Meta: model = Product fields = ('name', 'project') or, more concisely: class ProductForm(ModelForm): class Meta: model = Product fields = ('name', 'project') labels = {'name': 'Product Name', 'project': 'Parent Project'} widgets = { 'name': TextInput({'class': 'form-control mb-2', 'placeholder': 'Product Name'}) 'project': NumberInput({'class': 'form-control mb-2', 'readonly': 'readonly'}) }\n",

      "\n",
      "ForeignKey in Django forms allows you to link a model instance to another model instance through a unique identifier (usually an integer representing the primary key). While powerful, it does have certain limitations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Limited Input Options**: ForeignKey fields only allow users to input an existing ID from the linked model, not arbitrary text. They do not support free-form text entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **No Autocomplete**: Unlike CharField or TextField, ForeignKey fields do not come with built-in autocomplete functionality. Users must manually type the exact ID of the desired object.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Manual ID Management**: The user must manage the IDs themselves. If a user wants to reference a new object that hasn't been created yet, they'll need to first create it, get its ID, and then input that ID into the ForeignKey field.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No Validation on Linked Object**: Django doesn't validate whether the referenced object exists before saving. It assumes that the user has correctly entered an existing ID. Any validation on the existence or state of the linked object must be implemented manually in the view or form's clean method.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cannot Create New Objects Directly**: A ForeignKey cannot be used to create a new object within the same form submission. If creating a new object is needed, you should consider using a OneToOneField or a ManyToManyField with a through model.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Widget Limitations**: While you can customize the widget of a ForeignKey field, the options are limited compared to regular fields. For instance, you can't use a SearchInput widget out of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **No Support for Multiple Instances**: A single ForeignKey field can only reference one instance of another model. If you need to reference multiple instances, consider using a ManyToManyField or a GenericRelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Performance Considerations**: Querying many-to-many relationships or large sets of related objects can impact performance. Django's ORM is designed to handle such cases efficiently, but it's something to be aware of when designing complex data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these limitations, consider using ModelChoiceField in conjunction with a queryset, providing a dropdown list of possible values for users to choose from. This allows for more flexibility and control over the selection process, especially when dealing with large datasets or when creating new objects.\n",

      "2. **Add Files to the Staging Area:**\n",

      "5. **Set Remote URL:**\n",
      "   In your local repository, set the remote URL of your VPS repository as the origin by running `git remote add origin user@<ip>:/home/user/your-project.git`. Replace `<ip>` with your actual IP address.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Push Changes to VPS:**\n",
      "   Push your local commits to the VPS repository by executing `git push -u origin master`. The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch for tracking, so subsequent pushes can be done with just `git push`.\n",

      "2. The given code checks for intersections by comparing the boundaries of the new interval (`new_start_time` and `new_end_time`) against those of each existing interval (`Slot.start_time` and `Slot.end_time`). There are four conditions to check:\n",

      "Distinction between a class (custom data structure) and a namedtuple in Python\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on your needs. Each of them has own benefits. Here is a good explanation of Dataclasses on PyCon 2018 Raymond Hettinger - Dataclasses: The code generator to end all code generators (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TwcmT6Rcw&t=1390) In Dataclass all implementation is written in Python, whereas in NamedTuple, all of these behaviors come for free because NamedTuple inherits from tuple. And because the tuple structure is written in C, standard methods are faster in NamedTuple (hash, comparing and etc). Note also that Dataclass is based on dict whereas NamedTuple is based on tuple. Thus, you have advantages and disadvantages of using these structures. For example, space usage is less with a NamedTuple, but time access is faster with a Dataclass. Please, see my experiment: In [33]: a = PageDimensionsDC(width=10, height=10) In [34]: sys.getsizeof(a) + sys.getsizeof(vars(a)) Out[34]: 168 In [35]: %timeit a.width 43.2 ns ± 1.05 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) In [36]: a = PageDimensionsNT(width=10, height=10) In [37]: sys.getsizeof(a) Out[37]: 64 In [38]: %timeit a.width 63.6 ns ± 1.33 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each) But with increasing the number of attributes of NamedTuple access time remains the same small, because for each attribute it creates a property with the name of the attribute. For example, for our case the part of the namespace of the new class will look like: from operator import itemgetter class_namespace = { ... 'width': property(itemgetter(0, doc=\"Alias for field number 0\")), 'height': property(itemgetter(0, doc=\"Alias for field number 1\"))** } In which cases namedtuple is still a better choice? When your data structure needs to/can be immutable, hashable, iterable, unpackable, comparable then you can use NamedTuple. If you need something more complicated, for example, a possibility of inheritance for your data structure then use Dataclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an analogy (albeit an imperfect one), you can think of enum.Enum and namedtuple in python as enum and struct in C. In other words, enums are a way of aliasing values, while namedtuple is a way of encapsulating data by name. The two are not really interchangeable, and you can use enums as the named values in a namedtuple. I think this example illustrates the difference. from collections import namedtuple from enum import Enum class HairColor(Enum): blonde = 1 brown = 2 black = 3 red = 4 Person = namedtuple('Person', ['name','age','hair_color']) bert = Person('Bert', 5, HairColor.black) You can access the named \"attributes\" of the person the same way you would a regular object. >>> print(bert.name) Bert >>> print(bert.age) 5 >>> print(bert.hair_color) HairColor.black >>> print(bert.hair_color.value) 3 You often don't see namedtuples like this because the same essential concept can be accomplished by using the more widely known class declaration. The class definition below behaves almost identically to the namedtuple definition above. class Person: def __init__(self, name, age, hair_color): self.name = name self.age = age self.hair_color = hair_color However, a major difference between a namedtuple and a class object is that the attributes of a namedtuple cannot be changed after its creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From an API viewpoint, probably not much, though: namedtuple keys are always strings with some limitations: Any valid Python identifier may be used for a fieldname except for names starting with an underscore. Valid identifiers consist of letters, digits, and underscores but do not start with a digit or underscore and cannot be a keyword such as class, for, return, global, pass, or raise. namedtuples can always be accessed as regular tuples. Internally they are very different: Named tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples.\n",

      "Answer: \n",
      "### ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "A `class` in Python is a custom data structure that allows you to define your own objects with their own attributes and methods. It provides flexibility and extensibility, enabling features like inheritance and method overriding. Classes are mutable, meaning you can change their attributes after creation. They are implemented in Python and are generally slower compared to built-in types due to the overhead of dynamic dispatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, `namedtuple` is a factory function provided by the `collections` module that creates a subclass of tuple with named fields. NamedTuples are immutable, meaning once created, their fields cannot be modified. This immutability makes them lightweight and efficient since they only store the data without any additional metadata like a dictionary. They inherit from the tuple type, making them fast for accessing individual elements via indexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, use a `class` when you need more control over the behavior of your objects, including the ability to modify their state and add methods. Use `namedtuple` when you want an immutable, lightweight data carrier with named fields, where speed of access is crucial and mutability is not required. Additionally, consider using `namedtuple` if your data structure fits well into the tuple paradigm (e.g., ordered, fixed set of heterogeneous items).\n",

You may need to check for updates from the \"Beta channel\" (it is usually \"Stable channel\" by default). You can do this by clicking File -> Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Updates and making sure to check the \"Automatically check for updates\" box, as well as \"Beta channel\" in the drop-down list. Android Studio updates settings to fix GPU driver issue with emulator (https://i.stack.imgur.com/3yQ4V.png) After this is all completed, try restarting Android Studio and then do a fresh clean/rebuild of the project.

      "\n",
      "The issue you're encountering with your Android application crashing in the emulator environment could be due to several reasons. Here are some potential solutions based on the context provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Downgrade Emulator Version**: Switching your emulator from Android 11 to Android 9 (Pie) resolved the issue for some users. This might indicate that certain features or changes introduced in Android 11 are causing compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adjust Heap Size**: If your application requires more heap memory, increasing the maximum VM application heap size in the AVD (Android Virtual Device) editor can help. Set the value to 32MB and reboot the emulator.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistent Implementation Versions**: Ensure that all library dependencies in your project use the same version. Mixing different versions (e.g., 28.0.0 and 26.1.0) can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Avoid Deprecated Methods**: The `Thread.stop()` method is deprecated and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. Replace it with appropriate thread management techniques to prevent crashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Launch Emulator Correctly**: Sometimes, the emulator might behave differently depending on how it's launched. Try launching the emulator through the AVD Manager rather than via debugging or execution within Android Studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Update Android Studio and Emulator**: Ensuring that both Android Studio and the emulator are up to date can resolve many issues, including those related to GPU drivers and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Match Target SDK Version**: Make sure the target SDK version specified in your `build.gradle` file (`android:targetSdkVersion`) matches the API level of your emulator. Using incompatible versions can cause runtime errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Use Genymotion**: Consider using Genymotion, a faster alternative to the built-in Android emulator, which might offer better stability and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Clean and Rebuild Project**: A fresh clean and rebuild of your project can sometimes resolve issues caused by stale build artifacts or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If none of these solutions work, consider providing more detailed information about the crash logs and specific error messages to get more targeted assistance.\n",

      "  </div>\n",
      "</div>\n",

      "Invoke __setattr__ exclusively for non-existent attributes\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONTEXT:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This looks a bit like premature optimization : you want to skip a method call by making a descriptor change itself. It's perfectly possible, but it would have to be justified. To modify the descriptor from your property, you'd have to be editing your class, which is probably not what you want. I think a better way to implement this would be to : do not define obj.attr override __getattr__, if argument is \"attr\", obj.attr = new_value, otherwise raise AttributeError As soon as obj.attr is set, __getattr__ will not be called any more, as it is only called when the attribute does not exist. (__getattribute__ is the one that would get called all the time.) The main difference with your initial proposal is that the first attribute access is slower, because of the method call overhead of __getattr__, but then it will be as fact as a regular __dict__ lookup. Example : class MyClass(object): def __getattr__(self, name): if name == 'attr': self.attr = ... return self.attr raise AttributeError(name) obj = MyClass() print obj.attr # First calculation print obj.attr # Cached result is used EDIT : Please see the other answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/41879250/1011859), especially if you use Python 3.6 or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "__getattr__ is only called when an attribute isn’t found normally, but __setattr__ has no such restriction (that’s why there’s no equivalent of __getattribute__ for it). You overrode __setattr__ to not actually set an instance attribute, so the attribute is always missing and __getattr__ is called anyway. (Yes, it applies in __init__ too.) Remove __setattr__ to see your expected behaviour quickly, or add its default behaviour back: def __setattr__(self, attr, value): print('set ' + attr) super().__setattr__(attr, value)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can override __setattr__ to either prevent any changes: def __setattr__(self, name, value): raise AttributeError('''Can't set attribute \"{0}\"'''.format(name)) or prevent adding new attributes: def __setattr__(self, name, value): if not hasattr(self, name): raise AttributeError('''Can't set attribute \"{0}\"'''.format(name)) # Or whatever the base class is, if not object. # You can use super(), if appropriate. object.__setattr__(self, name, value) You can also replace hasattr with a check against a list of allowed attributes: if name not in list_of_allowed_attributes_to_change: raise AttributeError('''Can't set attribute \"{0}\"'''.format(name)) Another approach is to use properties instead of plain attributes: class A(object): def __init__(self, first, second): self._first = first self._second = second @property def first(self): return self._first @property def second(self): return self._second\n",
      "\n",

      "Disclaimer: I have no idea why you want to do this. If you want to dynamically create an attribute using setattr ought to be enough: SC = SimpleClass() setattr(SC, 'your_new_attribute_name', 'test') Anyway, there is a simple way of obtaining what you want using an helper class: In [1]: class SimpleClass: ...: def __getattr__(self, attr): ...: return AttributeSetter(self, attr) ...: class AttributeSetter: ...: def __init__(self, inst, attr): ...: self._inst = inst ...: self._attr = attr ...: def add(self, value): ...: setattr(self._inst, self._attr, value) ...: In [2]: SC = SimpleClass() In [3]: SC.new_attr.add('test') In [4]: SC.new_attr Out[4]: 'test' Regarding your comment. If you are asking whether it is possible to write SimpleClass such that: SC.new_attr return the string 'test' and, after calling Sc.new_attr.add('test') the call: SC.new_attr.add('other') Is such that: SC.new_attr now returns the string 'other', then the answer is: No, it's impossible. It's impossible to write a class such that the following does not produce an AttributeError: In [2]: SC = SimpleClass() In [3]: SC.new_attr.add('test') In [4]: SC.new_attr #this returns a string, not a user-defined class 'test' In [5]: SC.new_attr.add('new value') --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-5-f218074b7a68> in <module>() ----> 1 SC.new_attr.add('new value') AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'add' Why do you ask? Well, let's look at what the interpreter actually does: In [5]: import dis ...: dis.dis(lambda: SC.new_attr.add('some string')) ...: 2 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (SC) 3 LOAD_ATTR 1 (new_attr) 6 LOAD_ATTR 2 (add) 9 LOAD_CONST 1 ('some string') 12 CALL_FUNCTION 1 (1 positional, 0 keyword pair) 15 RETURN_VALUE The dis module allows us to look at the bytecode that the interpreter is executing. Note how there are two, distinct LOAD_ATTR bytecodes. As you can see the interpreter first gets the new_attr attribute and afterwards, as a completely independent operation, it retrieves the add attribute. Now, the class SC can only modify the behaviour of the first attribute access(i.e. the access to new_attr). It has no way of knowing that the next bytecode will access add, hence the only sensible thing to do is to return the string that was set. The following attribute access, the add, is done on the value retrieved. This means that the interpreter looks for the add attribute of the string, which obviously doesn't exist. The only way to avoid this AttributeError would be to return an object that has an add method, but this means that doing: In [6]: SC.new_attr Out[6]: 'test' Would fail because instead of returning the string \"test\" we'd return a different object. A way around this would be to return an object that has an add method and also a value attribute, so that we'd obtain something like: In [12]: SC.new_attr Out[12]: <__main__.TheClass at 0x7fac44727a90> In [13]: SC.new_attr.value Out[13]: 'test' In [14]: SC.new_attr.add('other') In [15]: SC.new_attr.value Out[15]: 'other' A different solution would be to write this class so that it behaves like a string(we could even subclass str but don't do it! subclassing built-in is never the right thing to do, and if you do it without knowing the exact consequences you will have problems and they will be hard to spot and solve), but this means that the code would become a lot more complex, having to implement all the operations that string support(which means implementing about 80-90-100 methods!)\n",

      "If you're looking for absolute private methods, then python is the wrong language for you - go to Java or C/++/# or some other language that supports the distinction between public and private. In python, if it is known something exists, then it is generally possible to access that thing no matter how hidden it is. If you're simply trying to limit the convenient options of the user when they import your module, then you can simply selectively include or exclude methods in __init__.py. Say that you have test.py def a(): pass def b(): pass def c(): pass and you wanted a and b to be accessible to the user but c not to be, then you could do __init__.py from .test import a, b and export the folder as a module. Now, when a user does import test they get access to only the stuff that's in the namespace by the end of __init__.py (that is, they can get test.a and test.b, but test.c doesn't exist). Since you never included c in __init__.py, it doesn't appear there. Note that c would still be accessible by doing from test.test import c which accesses the sourcefile directly. Alternatively, you can designate on a per-file basis which names should be immediately accessible by using a built-in variable __all__. The following will have the same effect as the above code: test.py ... __all__ = ['a', 'b'] # note that 'c' is excluded __init__.py from test.py import * # imports a and b, but not c\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is your module mymodule.py: def expose_this(): print('yes please') def but_not_this(): print('definitely not') Importing it directly like this: import mymodule Gives a user access to mymodule.expose_this() and mymodule.but_not_this(), there's no way to change that, although you could call but_not_this something like _but_not_this instead and many editors would at least warn a user that they are not supposed to access that. However, the right way to do it would be to create a package. Put your module in a separate folder (called mymodule), and add an __init__.py with this: from .mymodule import expose_this Now, if someone imports your package using the same import statement as before, they only have access to mymodule.expose_this() import mymodule mymodule.expose_this() # this works mymodule.but_not_this() # this causes an error There's a lot more to say about creating packages and how to add content, but there's good documentation and tutorials for that out there. Note: if someone knows the internal structure of your module, they can still access but_not_this() with this: import mymodule mymodule.mymodule.but_not_this() But they'd have to really want to - making it impossible is hard and there's really no point, since someone will be able to get at your code anyway, if they need to. But if you want to make the intent clear, you could rename mymodule.py to _mymodule.py and prefix the functions you don't want exposed with a _ as well - this helps editors to reinforce your intentions with the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I thought(!) one could do the same for global functions - to make a global function module-only. You were incorrect. Using a double-underscore name for a module-level function will not prevent it from being used in other modules. Someone can still do import yourmodule and then call yourmodule.__globalfoo. The double-underscore name mangling behavior is defined in the docs (https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables-and-class-local-references): Any identifier of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class. It is purely a textual substitution and takes no account of what (if anything) the double-underscore name refers to. It just takes any identifier occurring anywhere inside the class definition that looks like __blah and changes it to _class__blah. It is specific to class definitions and does not occur for module-level functions. The best thing to do is prefix your function with a single underscore and document that it is not part of the public API and users of the module should not rely on it. There is nothing to be gained by attempting to \"enforce\" this privacy.\n",

      "Rather than controlling access to your \"inner functions\" by nesting them, use either or both of: naming conventions (a leading underscore on a name means private-by-convention, see the style guide (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables)); and defining a list named __all__ to specify what gets imported from the package by default (see the tutorial on modules (https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package)). In use: # define the names that get imported from this package __all__ = ['outer_func']` def _inner_func(...): \"\"\"Private-by-convention inner function.\"\"\" ... def outer_func(...): \"\"\"Public outer function to call _inner_func.\"\"\" ...

      "\n",
      "In Python, there isn't a strict concept of private variables or methods like in languages such as Java or C++. However, Python does provide a convention to indicate that a variable or method is intended to be private. This is achieved by prefixing the name with a double underscore (`__`). Although this doesn't enforce privacy, it serves as a strong hint to other developers that the variable or method should not be accessed directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To establish encapsulated functions within a Python module, you can follow these guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use Naming Conventions**: Prefix names with a single underscore (`_`) to indicate that they are intended to be private by convention. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class MyModule:\n",
      "    def _private_function(self):\n",
      "        # Implementation here\n",
      "        pass\n",
      "\n",
      "    def public_function(self):\n",
      "        # Public implementation here\n",
      "        pass\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this case, `_private_function` is considered private by convention, while `public_function` is intended for external use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define `__all__**: Within your module, define a list named `__all__` to specify which names should be imported by default when the module is imported. This allows you to control the public interface of your module. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# mymodule.py\n",
      "\n",
      "def _private_function():\n",
      "    # Implementation here\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "\n",
      "def public_function():\n",
      "    # Public implementation here\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "\n",
      "__all__ = ['public_function']\n",
      "```\n",
      "When a user imports your module with `import mymodule`, they will only have access to `public_function`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Encapsulate with Classes**: Encapsulation is commonly achieved through classes in Python. Define attributes and methods within a class to control their visibility and accessibility. For instance:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class MyModule:\n",
      "    def __init__(self):\n",
      "        self.__private_attribute = None  # Private attribute\n",
      "\n",
      "    @property\n",
      "    def public_attribute(self):\n",
      "        return self.__private_attribute\n",
      "\n",
      "    @public_attribute.setter\n",
      "    def public_attribute(self, value):\n",
      "        self.__private_attribute = value\n",
      "```\n",
      "Here, `__private_attribute` is considered private because its name starts with a double underscore. It cannot be accessed directly outside the class. Instead, users can interact with it through the `public_attribute` property.\n",

      "The for-in loop is not for looping through entries in arrays or array-like things (what you get back from getElementsByClassName is an array-like object called a NodeList). It's for looping through the enumerable names of properties of an object. Using for-in on a host-provided object (like a NodeList) is not guaranteed to work. Use a nice simple for loop, or convert the NodeList into an array and use forEach on it (you can shim forEach on the few remaining browsers that don't have it). Here's an example: Array.prototype.slice.call(prewraps, 0).forEach(function(element) { // ...use the element here }); (The slice thing is a convenient way to create an array out of any array-like object.)

See here (http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/domstructure), click the link \"getElementsByTagName('element_name')\" Furthermore, for..in is not meant to be used for iterating over an array anyway. Use var item; for (var idx=0, len=arr.length; idx<len; ++idx) { item = arr[idx]; // whatever } for array iteration. For a nodelist, you can get the element with list.item(idx); // where list is what you got from getElementsByTagName if you want to do it \"right\".\n",

For example: >>> for (var j in document.getElementsByTagName('body')) console.log(j) 0 length item namedItem Therefore, in your for/in loop, i will go up to array.length + 2 instead of array.length - 1. Since array[array.length + 2] does not exist, it will return undefined and throw the error when you try to access a property of it. Just always use for (var i = 0, len = array.length; i < len; ++ i) { ... } with arrays.\n",

There are some Array like things you can do with a NodeList, and you can even .apply some Array.prototype methods to them, but you should read the docs to avoid the \"gotchas\", especially where problems with the NodeList being \"live\" could bite you.\n",

Use a simple for or one of the \"array like\" approaches in this answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript/9329476#9329476) (which also explains why for-in isn't the right choice here). I suspect the problem is that there are no enumerable properties in the HTMLCollection on the platform where you're seeing the problem. So for instance: for (var element = 0 ; element < inputs.length; ++elements) { In modern environments, HTMLCollection (what you get back from getElementsByTagName) may have the non-standard extension making it iterable (ES2015+) and giving it a forEach. If not, you can easily add it: if (typeof NodeList !== \"undefined\" && NodeList.prototype && !NodeList.prototype.forEach) { // Yes, direct assignment is fine here, no need for `Object.defineProperty` NodeList.prototype.forEach = Array.prototype.forEach; } if (typeof HTMLCollection !== \"undefined\" && HTMLCollection.prototype && !HTMLCollection.prototype.forEach) { // Yes, direct assignment is fine here, no need for `Object.defineProperty` HTMLCollection.prototype.forEach = Array.prototype.forEach; } That code does both HTMLCollection and NodeList (what you get from querySelectorAll). Then you can use: inputs.forEach(function(input) { if (input.checked) { // ... } });\n",

      "Correction: getElementsByTagName returns a NodeList, which has numeric indices and a length property, thereby making it an Array-like object. Nevertheless, you should just use a simple for loop like so: var els = document.getElementsByTagName('div'); for(var i = 0, j = els.length; i < j; i++) { alert(els[i].nodeName); The reason why you want to use for and not for..in here is because for..in uses inherited properties of the iterated object, so to avoid that you can use hasOwnProperty, but in this case where you're only iterating over a numeric indice, I think it's better to use a simple for loop over using for..in and hasOwnProperty.\n",

The calls to \"getElementsByName\" are returning empty node lists, so your \"for\" loops don't do anything.\n",

Instead: for (var index = 0; index < foo.length; ++index) { if (foo[index].value === 'whatever') { return 1; } } The for ... in form of loop is for going through properties of an Object. What you've got here is, indeed, an object, but more importantly it's something that acts more like an array. (It's a NodeList HTMLCollection, really, but for content traversal it can be treated like an array.) The advantage to iterating by numeric index is that you avoid tripping over properties of the object that really aren't part of its conceptual contents. Your other problem was using \"element\" in that indexing expression; I don't know what \"element\" is/was but you want to use the iterator variable. edit — The difference between what I thought the \"elements\" thing is (a NodeList) and what it actually is (an HTMLCollection) is that the collection API has both a numerically-indexed facade and a name-indexed facade. The thing is, if you somehow know the names external to the form, then the by-name access method makes sense. However, with what you're doing, I'd still use a numeric iterator, because otherwise things get kind-of muddy (to me). It may be that I'm just overly paranoid, so perhaps somebody with more insight will comment or answer.

When you reassign it you basically create a new variable within the nested function. To get around that, you wrap your value in a list and reassign the list's element instead. This is a problem in python 2. Python 3 fixes it through the use of the nonlocal statement: http://technotroph.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/python-closures-and-the-python-2-7-nonlocal-solution/ (http://technotroph.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/python-closures-and-the-python-2-7-nonlocal-solution/)\n",

Putting a global declaration at the top level is useless. Python doesn't allow for the same name to refer to two different scopes inside a single scope so the assignment global_var2 = 3 imposes that the variable is local. Thus if you try to print it before it raises an error. But if you say to python that the name is actually the global name then python knows that he should take the value from that scope and assign to the global scope. In particular: a = 1 def f(): print(a) a = 2 Here the a in print(a) and the a in a = 2 always refer to the same variable. In the above code the inside f is local because no declaration is provided and there is an assignment. So print(a) tries to access a local variable that doesn't have a value. If you add global: a = 1 def f(): global a print(a) a = 2 Now all the as in f refer to the global a, so print(a) prints 1 because it's the value of the global variable and after executing f the value will become 2.\n",

It's the first thing that comes up when you google 'Python UnboundLocalError'. From Python's FAQ: This is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope, that variable becomes local to that scope and shadows any similarly named variable in the outer scope. Since the last statement in foo assigns a new value to x, the compiler recognizes it as a local variable. Consequently when the earlier print(x) attempts to print the uninitialized local variable and an error results. Simply, redefining the variable redefines its scope, and thus removes the variable from the outer scope. The solution to this is to use the global or nonlocal keywords. In the example in question, global will not work (as a_variable) is not global, but nonlocal will work. Explicitly, it tells the inner function to use the variable in the outer scope.

But they are NOT The index3 within the my_func is a local variable. While the one in your program (the one not in the function) index3 is different!. So what happens in the above code is that first print(index3) prints the index3 in my code (not in any functions..just in my program) then my_func() gets called and print(index3) within my_func() prints the local variable index3 Take a look at this! def my_func(): print(index3) index3=10; print(index3) my_func() output: 10 10 See now both times the index3 which is same 10 this means it prints the global variable two times. Now comes your problem!: def my_func(): index3 =index3+1 index3=10; print(index3) my_func() output: 10 Traceback (most recent call last): File \"/home/mr/func.py\", line 6, in <module> my_func() File \"/home/mr/func.py\", line 2, in my_func index3 =index3+1 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'index3' referenced before assignment Why? Because of this index3 =index3+1 So the moment it sees a index3= it creates a local variable. So index3=0 means assign 0 to local variable. However index3 =index3+1 would confuse it! It thinks Wait you want me to assign local variable index3 as local variable index3+1 ? But you haven't even declared it yet! def my_func(): global index3 index3 =index3+1 print(index3) index3=10 print(index3) my_func() print(index3) output: 10 11 11 Now it takes the global value within the function and it changes. So index3 is changed by the function. NOTE: Using global variables is bad coding practice. def getIndex3(): return index3 def my_func(): index3 = getIndex3() index3 =index3+1 print(index3) index3=10 print(index3) my_func() print(index3) Now output: 10 11 10 You get the difference right?

      "a = 1 def func3(x): global a a = x + a return(x) print(func3(3)) Now it should work. When you put the statement a=x+a inside the function, it creates a new local variable a and tries to reference its value(which clearly hasnt been defined before). Thus you have to use global a before altering the value of a global variable so that it knows which value to refer to. EDIT: The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.\n",

      "The short answer is that, within g(), you need to declare global a if you want to be able to modify \"a\" from within a function and have this effect globally visible. However, in your case, the effect of using \"a\" within g() is to convert this variable name to refer to a local-scope variable, which then hides the global \"a\" which you're attempting to use on the righthand side of your assignment, triggering the exception.

      "\n",
      "In Python, when you define a variable outside of a function, it becomes a global variable. If you want to modify a global variable inside a function, you need to use the `global` keyword to indicate that you want to use the global variable, not create a new local one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "a = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "def func():\n",
      "    global a  # This line tells Python that you want to use the global 'a', not create a new local one\n",
      "    a = 2     # Now this assignment affects the global 'a'\n",
      "\n",
      "func()\n",
      "print(a)    # Outputs: 2\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In your specific case, if you want to modify the global variable `a` inside the function `g()`, you should add `global a` at the beginning of the function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "a = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "def g():\n",
      "    global a  # Declare 'a' as global\n",
      "    a = a + 1  # Now this affects the global 'a'\n",
      "\n",
      "g()\n",
      "print(a)    # Outputs: 2\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't use `global a`, Python will create a new local variable `a` inside the function `g()`, and any attempt to modify this local `a` won't affect the global `a`. This is why you're getting the `UnboundLocalError`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, using global variables can make your code harder to understand and maintain, so it's generally better to pass them as arguments to functions when possible, rather than modifying them directly.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Identify the User:** First, you need to identify the socket instance of the user you want to send a message to. In most cases, you would have stored the socket instances in an object when users connect to your server, like so:\n",

      "\n",
      "To resolve the `OAUTH_APPROVAL_ERROR_GENERIC` authentication issue when integrating Spring MVC with Apache Oltu and Salesforce, you need to ensure that your application correctly handles the OAuth 2.0 flow, including token validation and authentication. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you address this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update Dependencies**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Spring Framework and Spring Security. The latest versions will include bug fixes and improvements that may help resolve your issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Configure Spring Security**: Your existing configuration looks good for setting up a resource server with OAuth2 and JWT support. However, you should ensure that all necessary beans are properly configured and annotated.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JWT Authentication Success Handler**: As mentioned, you need to declare a JWT authentication success handler in your XML or Java configuration. Here's how you can do it in Java:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    @Configuration\n",
      "    public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n",
      "\n",
      "        @Autowired\n",
      "        private JwtAuthenticationFilter jwtAuthenticationFilter;\n",
      "\n",
      "        @Override\n",
      "        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n",
      "            http\n",
      "               .authorizeRequests()\n",
      "                   .anyRequest().authenticated()\n",
      "               .and()\n",
      "               .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\n",
      "\n",
      "            http.csrf().disable();\n",
      "        }\n",
      "\n",
      "        @Bean\n",
      "        public JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint jwtAuthenticationEntryPoint() {\n",
      "            return new JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint();\n",
      "        }\n",
      "\n",
      "        @Bean\n",
      "        public JwtAuthenticationFilter jwtAuthenticationFilter(JwtAuthenticationSuccessHandler successHandler) {\n",
      "            return new JwtAuthenticationFilter(successHandler);\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "    In this example, we've added a custom `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint` and configured it with a `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. The filter uses a `JwtAuthenticationSuccessHandler` to handle successful authentication events.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Handle Token Validation**: Ensure that your application correctly validates tokens received from Salesforce. You can use the `@PreAuthorize` annotation on your controllers or methods to enforce token validation:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    @GetMapping(\"/protected\")\n",
      "    @PreAuthorize(\"isAuthenticated()\")\n",
      "    public String protectedEndpoint() {\n",
      "        // Your code here\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for OAuth2 errors, including the `OAUTH_APPROVAL_ERROR_GENERIC`. You can create a custom exception handler to manage these errors gracefully:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
