And not just because they\\'re open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or \"hooks\" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"designer\" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=\"http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>\\n\\n<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=\"http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup\" rel=\"noreferrer\">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>\\n\\n<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat \"integrated\" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I\\'d like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the \"static-analysis\" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a \"unified\" solution? (I\\'ve asked this question separately <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity\">here</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><p>This is often called the \"Emacs format,\" but even if you aren\\'t using Emacs, it\\'s a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">filterchains</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><p>The second \"integration\" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you\\'re suppressing a warning, you\\'re suppressing a warning, so why not always write \"<code>SuppressWarning</code>?\"</p>\\n\\n<p><p>For example, PMD\\'s default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string \"<code>NOPMD</code>\" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java\\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing \"<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>\" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><p>Only the \"<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>\" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD\\'s support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(\"PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals\") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle\\'s \"SuppressionCommentFilter\") to use the strings \"<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" and \"<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: \"Effective Java,\" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>\\n<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own \"<code>BEGIN/END</code>\" comment pair.</p>\\n\\n<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java\\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(\"UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR\")</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string \"<code>SuppressWarnings</code>\" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>\\n'},\n",

Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s nothing special about <code>BigDecimal.round()</code> <em>vs.</em> any other <code>BigDecimal</code> method.  In all cases, the <code>MathContext</code> specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>MathContext</code></a>.  There\\'s a precision, and there\\'s also a <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>RoundingMode</code></a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify <code>123</code> as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\\'re going to get <code>120</code>.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.</p>\\n\\n<p><code>123</code> would be <code>1.23e2</code> in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get <code>1.2e2</code>, or <code>120</code>.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.</p>\\n\\n<p>The <code>RoundingMode</code> part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use <code>123</code> as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\\'ve reduced your precision.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>HALF_UP</code> (the default mode), <code>123</code> will become <code>120</code>.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>CEILING</code>, you\\'ll get <code>130</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\\n                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\\n                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Outputs:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>123.4\\n1.2E+2\\n1.3E+2\\n2E+2\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.</p>\\n'},\n",

Do you add those bean definitions to <code>services.xml</code>, or put them in their own <code>transactionPolicy.xml</code>? Talk it over with your team.

Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Integration testing</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>You can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only <code>datasource.xml</code> and <code>persistence.xml</code> beans).</p>\\n\\n<p>Specifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>@ContextConfiguration(locations = { \"/spring/datasource.xml\" , \"/spring/persistence.xml\" })\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><strong>Works well with Spring IDE\\'s Beans Graph</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Having lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE\\'s <a href=\"http://springide.org/project/wiki/BeansGraph\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beans Graph</a>.

I used swig extensively, boost.python some and pyrex and cython a lot. I also used ctypes. This is my breakdown:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is my personal experience. I am not involved with any of these projects. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>swig:</strong>\\ndoes not play well with c++. It should, but name mangling problems in the linking step was a major headache for me on linux &amp; Mac OS X. If you have C code and want it interfaced to python, it is a good solution. I wrapped the GTS for my needs and needed to write basically a C shared library which I could connect to. I would not recommend it.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Ctypes:</strong>\\nI wrote a libdc1394 (IEEE Camera library) wrapper using ctypes and it was a very straigtforward experience. You can find the code on <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/pydc1394\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://launchpad.net/pydc1394</a>. It is a lot of work to convert headers to python code, but then everything works reliably. This is a good way if you want to interface an external library. Ctypes is also in the stdlib of python, so everyone can use your code right away. This is also a good way to play around with a new lib in python quickly. I can recommend it to interface to external libs. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Boost.Python</strong>: Very enjoyable. If you already have C++ code of your own that you want to use in python, go for this. It is very easy to translate c++ class structures into python class structures this way. I recommend it if you have c++ code that you need in python. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pyrex/Cython:</strong> Use Cython, not Pyrex. Period. Cython is more advanced and more enjoyable to use. Nowadays, I do everything with cython that i used to do with SWIG or Ctypes. It is also the best way if you have python code that runs too slow. The process is absolutely fantastic: you convert your python modules into cython modules, build them and keep profiling and optimizing like it still was python (no change of tools needed). You can then apply as much (or as little) C code mixed with your python code. This is by far faster then having to rewrite whole parts of your application in C; you only rewrite the inner loop. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Timings</strong>: ctypes has the highest call overhead (~700ns), followed by boost.python (322ns), then directly by swig (290ns). Cython has the lowest call overhead (124ns) and the best feedback where it spends time on (cProfile support!). The numbers are from my box calling a trivial function that returns an integer from an interactive shell; module import overhead is therefore not timed, only function call overhead is. It is therefore easiest and most productive to get python code fast by profiling and using cython.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: For your problem, use Cython ;). I hope this rundown will be useful for some people. I\\'ll gladly answer any remaining question.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I forget to mention: for numerical purposes (that is, connection to NumPy) use Cython; they have support for it (because they basically develop cython for this purpose). So this should be another +1 for your decision. </p>\\n'},\n",

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>\\n\\n<p>To take it to the next level you\\'ll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=\"http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system.

I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the \"multiple\" regular expressions and build off of Sven\\'s idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I\\'m sorry I don\\'t know Python syntax and I\\'m a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>check_dict = {\\n  \\'delim\\'    : /\\\\-/,\\n  \\'parts\\'    : [ \\'Show Name\\', \\'Episode Name\\', \\'Episode Number\\' ],\\n  \\'patterns\\' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],\\n  \\'required\\' : [\\'list\\', \\'of\\', \\'files\\'],\\n  \\'ignored\\'  : [\\'.*\\', \\'hidden.txt\\'],\\n  \\'start_dir\\': \\'/path/to/dir/to/test/\\'\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Split the filename based on the delimiter.</li>\\n<li>Check each of the parts.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn\\'t match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the <code>parts</code> and <code>patterns</code> have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ignored and required files can be listed.  The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input \"globs\" which can be shell expanded.  I\\'m thinking here of <code>svn:ignore</code> properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here <code>start_dir</code> would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.</p>\\n\\n<p>The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for \"valid files\".  I really couldn\\'t come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.

I did this by waiting until there was a project for which I would be the only programmer, then getting permission to do this new project in Python.  I then did another small project in Python with similarly impressive results.  In addition, I used Python for all of my small throwaway assignments (\"can you parse the stats in these files into a CSV file organized by date and site?\", etc) and had a quick turnaround time on all of them.</p>\\n\\n<p>I also evangelized Python a bit; I went out of my way to NOT be obnoxious about it, but I\\'d occasionally describe why I liked it so much, talked about the personal projects I use it for in my free time and why it\\'s awesome for me, etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>Eventually we started another project and I convinced everyone to use Python for it.  I took care to point everyone to a lot of documentation, including the specific webpages relating to what they were working on, and every time they had a question, I\\'d explain how to do things properly by explaining the Pythonic approach to things, etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>This has worked really well.  However, this might be somewhat different than what you\\'re describing.  In my case I started with moderately small projects and Python is only being used for new projects.  Also, none of my co-workers were really Perl or PHP gurus; they all knew those languages and had been using them for awhile, but it didn\\'t take much effort for them to become more productive in Python than they\\'d been before.</p>\\n\\n<p>So if you\\'re talking about new projects with people who currently use PHP but aren\\'t super-experts and don\\'t love that language, then I think switching to Python is a no-brainer.  However, if you\\'re talking about working with a large existing PHP code base with a lot of very experienced PHP programmers who are happy with their current setup, then switching languages is probably not a good idea.  You\\'re probably somewhere in between, so you\\'ll have to weigh the tradeoffs; hopefully my answer will help you do that.</p>\\n'},\n",

For those that don\\'t know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the \"hard stuff.\"  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>\\n\\n<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don\\'t think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>\\n\\n<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>\\n',\n",

Lets face it: If you want to reach 100.000+ players, you\\'re ending up building your own technology stack, at least for the critical core. That\\'s what CCP did for EVE Online (<a href=\"http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=584\" rel=\"noreferrer\">StacklessIO</a>), that\\'s what Blizzard did for World of Warcraft (although they do use many third-party libraries), that\\'s what Mythic did for Warhammer Online (although they are based on Gamebryo).</p>\\n\\n<p>However, if you aim to be a small, niche MMO (like the dozens of Free-to-Play/Itemshop MMOs), then getting the Network stuff right is just insanely hard, data consistency is even harder and scalability is the biggest b*tch.</p>\\n\\n<p>But game technology is not your only problem - you also need to tackle Billing. Credit Card only? Have fun selling in Germany then, people there want ELV. That\\'s where you need a reliable billing provider, but you still need to wire in the billing application with your accounts to make sure that accounts are blocked/reactivated when the billing fails.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are some companies already offering \"MMO Infratructure Services\" (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.e-eis.com/cms/front_content.php?changelang=2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Arvato\\'s EEIS</a>), but the bottom line is: Stuff like Project Darkstar IS realistic, but assuming that you can build a Multi-Billion-MMO entirely on a Third Party Stack is optimistic, possibly idealistic.</p>\\n\\n<p>But then again, entirely inventing all of the technology is even more stupid - use the Third Party stuff that you need (i.e. Billing, Font Rendering, Audio Output...), but <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001172.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">write the stuff that really makes or breaks your business</a> (i.e. Network stack, User interface etc.) on your own. (Note: Jeff\\'s posting may be <a href=\"http://damilare.net/random-talks/dare-obasanjo-vs-jeff-atwood-on-html-validation/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a bit flawed</a>, but the overall direction is correct IMHO.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Addendum: Also, the game industry does license and reuse engines a lot. The most prominent game Engines are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Engine\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source Engine</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_tech\" rel=\"noreferrer\">id Tech</a>, which fuel dozens, if not hundreds of games. But there are some lesser-known (outside of the industry) engines. There is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gamebryo</a>, the Middleware behind games like Civilization 4 and Fallout 3, there was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RenderWare</a> that is now only EA-in-House, but used in games like Battlefield 2 or The Sims 3. There is the open source <a href=\"http://www.ogre3d.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ogre3d</a>, which was used in <a href=\"http://www.dtp-entertainment.com/en/games/game_detail.php?id=2973&amp;landid=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">some</a> commercial <a href=\"http://www.venetica-game.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">titles</a>. If you\\'re just looking for Sound, there\\'s stuff like <a href=\"http://www.fmod.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FMOD</a> or if you want to do font-rendering, why not give <a href=\"http://www.freetype.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FreeType</a> a spin?</p>\\n\\n<p>What I\\'m saying is: Third-Party Engines/Middleware do exist, and they ARE being successfully used since more than a decade (I know for sure that id\\'s Wolfenstein Engine was licensed to other companies, and that was 1992), even by big companies in multi-million-dollar titles. The important thing is the support, because a good engine with no help in case of an issue is pretty much worthless or at least very expensive if the developer has to spend their game-development-time with unneccessary debugging of the Engine.</p>\\n\\n<p>If the Darkstar folks manage to get the support side right and 2 or 3 higher profile titles out, I do believe it could succeed in opening the MMO market to a lot more smaller developers and indies.</p>\\n'},\n",

For example, if you\\'ve got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there\\'s nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you\\'ve got a lot of objects.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O\\'s text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They\\'ll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it\\'s easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we\\'ve hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some APIs don\\'t seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you\\'ve renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these \"reflection\" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don\\'t work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(\"someField\"), which is not strongly typed.</p>\\n\\n<p>We\\'ve witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.</p>\\n\\n<p>We\\'ve found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn\\'t exist anymore in the database.</p>\\n\\n<p>We\\'ve found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// C# syntax for \"Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23\".\\n// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)\\nIList&lt;MyFoo&gt; results = db4o.Query&lt;MyFoo&gt;(input =&gt; input.Bar == 23);\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.</p>\\n\\n<p>For .NET folks, they\\'ve recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it\\'s yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.</p>\\n\\n<p>DB4O support has been decent: we\\'ve talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you\\'ve got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We\\'ve had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)</p>\\n\\n<p>If all this hasn\\'t scared you off, let me say that we\\'re very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we\\'ve encountered.

For example, you try reading a file but someone deletes it between the time you check if it exists and the time the read operation begins. By declaring a checked exception, you are telling the caller to anticipate this failure.</li>\\n<li><strong>Reasonable to recover from</strong>: There is no point telling callers to anticipate exceptions that they cannot recover from. If a user attempts to read from an non-existing file, the caller can prompt them for a new filename. On the other hand, if the method fails due to a programming bug (invalid method arguments or buggy method implementation) there is nothing the application can do to fix the problem in mid-execution. The best it can do is log the problem and wait for the developer to fix it at a later time.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Unless the exception you are throwing meets <strong>all</strong> of the above conditions it should use an Unchecked Exception.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Reevaluate at every level</strong>: Sometimes the method catching the checked exception isn't the right place to handle the error. In that case, consider what is reasonable for your own callers. If the exception is predictable, unpreventable and reasonable for them to recover from then you should throw a checked exception yourself. If not, you should wrap the exception in an unchecked exception. If you follow this rule you will find yourself converting checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions and vice versa depending on what layer you are in.</p>\\n\\n<p>For both checked and unchecked exceptions, <strong>use the right abstraction level</strong>. For example, a code repository with two different implementations (database and filesystem) should avoid exposing implementation-specific details by throwing <code>SQLException</code> or <code>IOException</code>. Instead, it should wrap the exception in an abstraction that spans all implementations (e.g. <code>RepositoryException</code>).</p>\\n\"},\n",

If you\\'re not able to manipulate the server side to avoid sending a 401 response on failed credentials, then you will not be able to avoid this problem, because it\\'s part of the (client-side) spec:</p>\\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060619/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The XMLHttpRequest Object</a></h3>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>If the UA supports HTTP Authentication [RFC2617] it SHOULD consider requests\\noriginating from this object to be part of the protection space that includes the\\naccessed URIs and send Authorization  headers and handle 401 Unauthorised requests\\nappropriately. if authentication fails, UAs should prompt the users for credentials.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So the spec actually calls for the browser to prompt the user accordingly if any 401 response is received in an XMLHttpRequest, just as if the user had accessed the URL directly. As far as I can tell the only way to really avoid this would be for you to have control over the server side and cause 401 Unauthorized responses to be avoided, as Mark mentioned.</p>\\n<p>One last thought is that you may be able to get around this using a proxy, such a separate server side script on another webserver. That script then takes a user and pass parameter and checks the authentication, so that the user\\'s browser isn\\'t what\\'s making the original HTTP request and therefore isn\\'t receiving the 401 response that\\'s causing the prompt. If you do it this way you can find out from your &quot;proxy&quot; script if it failed, and if so then prompt the user again until it succeeds. On a successful authentication event, you can simply fetch the HTTP request as you are now, since everything works if the credentials are correctly specified.</p>\\n'},\n",

This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.</p>\\n<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial, doesn\\'t carry over to interpreted languages: what about a Python/Perl/Ruby plugin, which gets loaded via <code>import</code> or <code>execfile</code>?</p>\\n<p>(edit: I understand why the distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, but it seems like someone who wanted to comply with the GPL but go against the &quot;spirit&quot; --I don\\'t-- could just use fork/exec and interprocess communication to do pretty much anything).</p>\\n<p>The best solution would be to add an exception to my license to explicitly allow the use of proprietary plugins, but I am unable to do so since I\\'m using <a href=\"http://trolltech.com/products/qt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Qt</a>/<a href=\"http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PyQt</a> which is GPL.</p>\\n',\n",

Basically they are just making the division based upon the level of integration.  If the program has \"plugins\" which are essentially fire and forget with no API level integration, then the resulting work is unlikely to be considered a derived work.  Generally speaking a plugin which is merely forked/exec\\'ed would fit this criteria, though there may be cases where it does not.  This case especially applies if the \"plugin\" code would work independently of your code as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>If, on the other hand, the code is deeply dependent upon the GPL\\'ed work, such as extensively calling APIs, or tight data structure integration, then things are more likely to be considered a derived work.  Ie, the \"plugin\" cannot exist on its own without the GPL product, and a product with this plugin installed is essentially a derived work of the GPLed product.</p>\\n\\n<p>So to make it a little more clear, the same principles could apply to your interpreted code.  If the interpreted code relies heavily upon your APIs (or vice-versa) then it would be considered a derived work.

There's no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of <code>Person</code>, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains <code>Person</code> objects (so you get intellisense and so on).</p>\\n<p>The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn't understand these new <code>List&lt;something&gt;</code>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old <code>List</code> to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you're upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0</p>\\n<h2>Java Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>\\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren't <code>Person</code> into the list.</p>\\n<p>The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special <code>ListOfPerson</code> - it just uses the plain old <code>ArrayList</code> which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual <code>Person p = (Person)foo.get(1);</code> casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.<br />\\nWhen people mention &quot;Type Erasure&quot; this is what they're talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then 'erases' the fact that it's meant to be a list of <code>Person</code> not just <code>Object</code></p>\\n<p>The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn't understand generics doesn't have to care. It's still dealing with the same old <code>ArrayList</code> as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM's, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.</p>\\n<p>The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no <code>ListOfPerson</code> pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it's been converted into <code>Object</code> or so on) can't tell in any way that it's meant to be a list containing only <code>Person</code> and not just any other array list.</p>\\n<h2>C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this</h2>\\n<pre><code>std::list&lt;Person&gt;* foo = new std::list&lt;Person&gt;();\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.</p>\\n<p>It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special <code>pseudo-classes</code> rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it's a whole different kettle of fish.</p>\\n<p>Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a <code>Person</code> class in it, in both cases some information about a <code>Person</code> class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.</p>\\n<p>C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is <em>not</em> an object, and there's no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a <code>Person</code> class. There's no boxing or unboxing, and functions don't have to belong to classes, or indeed anything.</p>\\n<p>Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.<br />\\nThe most obvious example is adding things:</p>\\n<p>In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:</p>\\n<pre><code>string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>That code won't compile in C# or Java, because it doesn't know that the type <code>T</code> actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>interface IHasName{ string Name(); };\\nstring addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<code>&lt;T extends IHasName&gt;</code>), but it suffers from the same problems.</p>\\n<p>The 'classic' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this</p>\\n<pre><code>string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first + second; }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You can't actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the <code>+</code> method in it. You fail.</p>\\n<p>C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn't care about passing types down to any VM's - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don't, it won't. Simple.</p>\\n<p>So, there you have it :-)</p>\\n\"},\n",

This phase calls <em>processValidators</em> which will call <em>validate</em>. The <em>validate</em> method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls <em>setValue</em>. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to <em>getValue</em>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Update Model Values</strong>. This phase calls <em>processUpdates</em>. In an input component, this will call <em>updateModel</em> which will get the <em>ValueExpression</em> and invoke it to set the value on the model.</li>\\n<li><strong>Invoke Application</strong>. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).</li>\\n<li><strong>Render Response</strong>. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.</li>\\n<li>If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.</li>\\n<li>Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>This is a somewhat simplified version of events.

       "  'context': '<p>Unchecked exceptions are alright if you want to handle every failure the same way, for example by logging it and skipping to the next request, displaying a message to the user and handling the next event, etc. If this is my use case, all I have to do is catch some general exception type at a high level in my system, and handle everything the same way.</p>\\n\\n<p>But I want to recover from specific problems, and I\\'m not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.</p>\\n\\n<p>Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my \"action\", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an <code>org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException</code> (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I\\'d really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same \"we logged your problem but for now you\\'re hosed\" message.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don\\'t want to lock the whole user table between a \"SELECT\" to see if the name exists and an \"INSERT\" if it doesn\\'t. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I\\'m really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won\\'t work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.</li>\\n<li>Given my CTO\\'s propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in \"Inc.\", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?</li>\\n<li>One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to \"handle\" them in every call on the stack&mdash;either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch <code>IOException</code>, while a database implementation would catch <code>SQLException</code>, but both would throw a <code>UserNotFoundException</code> that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?</li>\\n</ol>\\n',\n",

       "  'accepted_answer': '<p>IMO, wrapping exceptions (checked or otherwise) has several benefits that are worth the cost:</p>\\n\\n<p>1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you\\'ll consider the exceptions you\\'ll throw for the code that calls yours.</p>\\n\\n<p>2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn\\'t available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).</p>\\n\\n<p>3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you\\'re wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it\\'s not just for wholesale technology replacement.</p>\\n\\n<p>4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can\\'t check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question (\"how do I recover?\") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a \"down for maintenance\" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that\\'s a good thing.</p>\\n'},\n",

Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).

We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren\\'t going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).

The only problem is that it doesn\\'t work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere which is exceeded/overflown by the content length of the file).</p>\\n\\n<p>The best solution would be a java applet or ActiveX component, since the problem only exist in IE, that would work like the article @spoulson linked to. However, so far I haven\\'t had any luck finding a solution that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>\\n\\n<p>It looks like we might have to write our own. Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works. The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>\\n',\n",

The Android SDK doesn't provide a direct method to change the indicator of a <code>TabHost</code> after it's been created.  The <code>TabSpec</code> is only used to build the tab, so changing the <code>TabSpec</code> after the fact will have no effect.</p>\\n\\n<p>I think there's a workaround, though.  Call <code>mTabs.getTabWidget()</code> to get a <code>TabWidget</code> object.  This is just a subclass of <code>ViewGroup</code>, so you can call <code>getChildCount()</code> and <code>getChildAt()</code> to access individual tabs within the <code>TabWidget</code>.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other <code>ViewGroup</code> (maybe a <code>LinearLayout</code>, but it doesn't matter) that contains an <code>ImageView</code> and a <code>TextView</code>.

       " '37141': {'question': 'Event handling in Dojo',\n",
       "  'context': '<p>Taking Jeff Atwood\\'s <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninjas/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">advice</a>, I decided to use a JavaScript library for the very basic to-do list application I\\'m writing. I picked the <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dojo toolkit</a>, version 1.1.1. At first, all was fine: the drag-and-drop code I wrote worked first time, you can drag tasks on-screen to change their order of precedence, and each drag-and-drop operation calls an event handler that sends an AJAX call to the server to let it know that order has been changed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then I went to add in the email tracking functionality. Standard stuff: new incoming emails have a unique ID number attached to their subject line, all subsequent emails about that problem can be tracked by simply leaving that ID number in the subject when you reply. So, we have a list of open tasks, each with their own ID number, and each of those tasks has a time-ordered list of associated emails. I wanted the text of those emails to be available to the user as they were looking at their list of tasks, so I made each task box a Dijit \"Tree\" control - top level contains the task description, branches contain email dates, and a single \"leaf\" off of each of those branches contains the email text.</p>\\n\\n<p>First problem: I wanted the tree view to be fully-collapsed by default. After searching Google quite extensively, I found a number of solutions, all of which seemed to be valid for previous versions of Dojo but not the one I was using. I eventually figured out that the best solution would seem to be to have a event handler called when the Tree control had loaded that simply collapsed each branch/leaf. Unfortunately, even though the Tree control had been instantiated and its \"startup\" event handler called, the branches and leaves still hadn\\'t loaded (the data was still being loaded via an AJAX call). So, I modified the system so that all email text and Tree structure is added server-side. This means the whole fully-populated Tree control is available when its startup event handler is called.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, the startup event handler fully collapses the tree. Next, I couldn\\'t find a \"proper\" way to have nice formatted text for the email leaves. I can put the email text in the leaf just fine, but any HTML gets escaped out and shows up in the web page. Cue more rummaging around Dojo\\'s documentation (tends to be out of date, with code and examples for pre-1.0 versions) and Google. I eventually came up with the solution of getting JavaScript to go and read the SPAN element that\\'s inside each leaf node and un-escape the escaped HTML code in it\\'s innerHTML. I figured I\\'d put code to do this in with the fully-collapse-the-tree code, in the Tree control\\'s startup event handler.</p>\\n\\n<p>However... it turns out that the SPAN element isn\\'t actually created until the user clicks on the expando (the little \"+\" symbol in a tree view you click to expand a node). Okay, fair enough - I\\'ll add the re-formatting code to the onExpand() event handler, or whatever it\\'s called. Which doesn\\'t seem to exist. I\\'ve searched to documentation, I\\'ve searched Google... I\\'m quite possibly mis-understanding Dojo\\'s \"publish/subscribe\" event handling system, but I think that mainly because there doesn\\'t seem to be any comprehensive documentation for it anywhere (like, where do I find out what events I can subscribe to?).</p>\\n\\n<p>So, in the end, the best solution I can come up with is to add an onClick event handler (not a \"Dojo\" event, but a plain JavaScript event that Dojo knows nothing about) to the expando node of each Tree branch that re-formats the HTML inside the SPAN element of each leaf. Except... when that is called, the SPAN element still doesn\\'t exist (sometimes - other times it\\'s been cached, just to further confuse you). Therefore, I have the event handler set up a timer that periodically calls a function that checks to see if the relevant SPAN element has turned up yet before then re-formatting it.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// An event handler called whenever a \"email title\" tree node is expanded.\\nfunction formatTreeNode(nodeID) {\\n    if (dijit.byId(nodeID).getChildren().length != 0) {\\n        clearInterval(nodeUpdateIntervalID);\\n        messageBody = dijit.byId(nodeID).getChildren()[0].labelNode.innerHTML\\n        if (messageBody.indexOf(\"&lt;b&gt;Message text:&lt;/b&gt;\") == -1) {\\n            messageBody = messageBody.replace(/&amp;gt;/g, \"&gt;\");\\n            messageBody = messageBody.replace(/&amp;lt;/g, \"&lt;\");\\n            messageBody = messageBody.replace(/&amp;amp;/g, \"&amp;\");\\n            dijit.byId(nodeID).getChildren()[0].labelNode.innerHTML = \"&lt;b&gt;Message text:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div style=\\\\\"font-family:courier\\\\\"&gt;\"+messageBody+\"&lt;/div&gt;\";\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// An event handler called when a tree node has been set up - we changed the default fully-expanded to fully-collapsed.\\nfunction setupTree(theTree) {\\n    dijit.byId(\"tree-\"+theTree).rootNode.collapse();\\n\\n    messageNode = dijit.byId(\"tree-\"+theTree).rootNode.getChildren();\\n    for (pl = 0; pl &lt; messageNode.length; pl++) {\\n        messageNode[pl].collapse();\\n        messageNode[pl].expandoNode.onclick = eval(\"nodeUpdateIntervalID = setInterval(\\\\\"formatTreeNode(\\'\"+messageNode[pl].id+\"\\')\\\\\",200); formatTreeNode(\\'\"+messageNode[pl].id+\"\\');\");\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The above has the feel of a truly horrible hack, and I feel sure I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere early on in my thought process.

After a quick research I found <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/ergo5.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine</a> and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as <code>64MB</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint?</p>\\n\\n<p>I could increase the <strong>max heap size</strong> using <strong>command line</strong> option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script.

       "  'accepted_answer': '<p>Ultimately you always have a finite max of heap to use no matter what platform you are running on. In Windows 32 bit this is around <code>2GB</code> (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java chooses to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can\\'t create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).</p>\\n\\n<p>So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you <strong>no longer</strong> are using, or allocating many objects when you could <strong>reuse</strong> them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is \"JMP\" <a href=\"http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. </p>\\n\\n<p>In general if you can\\'t guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say \"I need Xgb of memory\" for something and you can\\'t work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.</p>\\n'},\n",

This is a waste of resources and computation power.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, taking the union of <code>items()</code> in Python 3 (<code>viewitems()</code> in Python 2.7) will also fail when values are unhashable objects (like lists, for example). Even if your values are hashable, <strong>since sets are semantically unordered, the behavior is undefined in regards to precedence.

Personally, I find it more despicable than\\ncool.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It is my understanding (as well as the understanding of the <a href=\"https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2010-April/099485.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">creator of the language</a>) that the intended usage for <code>dict(**y)</code> is for creating dictionaries for readability purposes, e.g.:</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>dict(a=1, b=10, c=11)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>instead of</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>{\\'a\\': 1, \\'b\\': 10, \\'c\\': 11}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Response to comments</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Despite what Guido says, <code>dict(x, **y)</code> is in line with the dict specification, which btw. works for both Python 2 and 3. The fact that this only works for string keys is a direct consequence of how keyword parameters work and not a short-coming of dict. Nor is using the ** operator in this place an abuse of the mechanism, in fact, ** was designed precisely to pass dictionaries as keywords.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Again, it doesn\\'t work for 3 when keys are not strings. The implicit calling contract is that namespaces take ordinary dictionaries, while users must only pass keyword arguments that are strings. All other callables enforced it. <code>dict</code> broke this consistency in Python 2:</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(**{(\\'a\\', \\'b\\'): None})\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\\nTypeError: foo() keywords must be strings\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(**{(\\'a\\', \\'b\\'): None})\\n{(\\'a\\', \\'b\\'): None}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This inconsistency was bad given other implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython). Thus it was fixed in Python 3, as this usage could be a breaking change.</p>\\n<p>I submit to you that it is malicious incompetence to intentionally write code that only works in one version of a language or that only works given certain arbitrary constraints.</p>\\n<p>More comments:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><code>dict(x.items() + y.items())</code> is still the most readable solution for Python 2. Readability counts.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>My response: <code>merge_two_dicts(x, y)</code> actually seems much clearer to me, if we\\'re actually concerned about readability. And it is not forward compatible, as Python 2 is increasingly deprecated.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><code>{**x, **y}</code> does not seem to handle nested dictionaries. the contents of nested keys are simply overwritten, not merged [...] I ended up being burnt by these answers that do not merge recursively and I was surprised no one mentioned it. In my interpretation of the word &quot;merging&quot; these answers describe &quot;updating one dict with another&quot;, and not merging.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Yes.

This allows us to run actions in the following manner:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Process A, Thread 1</li>\\n<li>Process A, Thread 2</li>\\n<li>Process B, Thread 1</li>\\n<li>Process A, Thread 3</li>\\n<li>Process A, Thread 4</li>\\n<li>Process B, Thread 2</li>\\n<li>Pause Process A</li>\\n<li>Process B, Thread 3</li>\\n<li>Process B, Thread 4</li>\\n<li>Process B, Thread 5</li>\\n<li>Start Process A</li>\\n<li>Process A, Thread 5</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>This allows some form of scheduling and fakes parallelism, starting and stopping of threads, etcetera, but it will not be true multi-threading. I don’t think it will ever be implemented in the language itself, since true multi-threading is only useful if the browser can run a single page multi-threaded (or even more than one core), and the difficulties there are way larger than the extra possibilities.</p>\\n\\n<p>For the future of JavaScript, check this out: \\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170920070053/https://developer.mozilla.org/presentations/xtech2006/javascript/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://developer.mozilla.org/presentations/xtech2006/javascript/</a></p>\\n'},\n",

Attackers hijack sessions when predictable identifiers are used.</p>\\n<p>There is tension between length and security. Shorter identifiers are easier to guess, because there are fewer possibilities. But longer identifiers consume more storage and bandwidth. A larger set of symbols helps, but might cause encoding problems if identifiers are included in URLs or re-entered by hand.</p>\\n<p>The underlying source of randomness, or entropy, for session identifiers should come from a random number generator designed for cryptography. However, initializing these generators can sometimes be computationally expensive or slow, so effort should be made to re-use them when possible.</p>\\n<h2>Use as object identifiers</h2>\\n<p>Not every application requires security. Random assignment can be an efficient way for multiple entities to generate identifiers in a shared space without any coordination or partitioning. Coordination can be slow, especially in a clustered or distributed environment, and splitting up a space causes problems when entities end up with shares that are too small or too big.</p>\\n<p>Identifiers generated without taking measures to make them unpredictable should be protected by other means if an attacker might be able to view and manipulate them, as happens in most web applications. There should be a separate authorization system that protects objects whose identifier can be guessed by an attacker without access permission.</p>\\n<p>Care must be also be taken to use identifiers that are long enough to make collisions unlikely given the anticipated total number of identifiers. This is referred to as &quot;the birthday paradox.&quot; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Square_approximation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The probability of a collision,</a> <em>p</em>, is approximately n<sup>2</sup>/(2q<sup>x</sup>), where <em>n</em> is the number of identifiers actually generated, <em>q</em> is the number of distinct symbols in the alphabet, and <em>x</em> is the length of the identifiers. This should be a very small number, like 2<sup>‑50</sup> or less.</p>\\n<p>Working this out shows that the chance of collision among 500k 15-character identifiers is about 2<sup>‑52</sup>, which is probably less likely than undetected errors from cosmic rays, etc.</p>\\n<h2>Comparison with UUIDs</h2>\\n<p>According to their specification, <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">UUIDs</a> are not designed to be unpredictable, and <em>should not</em> be used as session identifiers.</p>\\n<p>UUIDs in their standard format take a lot of space: 36 characters for only 122 bits of entropy. (Not all bits of a &quot;random&quot; UUID are selected randomly.) A randomly chosen alphanumeric string packs more entropy in just 21 characters.</p>\\n<p>UUIDs are not flexible; they have a standardized structure and layout. This is their chief virtue as well as their main weakness. When collaborating with an outside party, the standardization offered by UUIDs may be helpful.

I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p>\\n\\n<p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK\\nServer  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2\\nDate    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT \\nVary    Cookie\\nContent-Length  2301\\nContent-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nDate    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT\\nServer  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch\\nVary    Cookie\\nContent-Length  2301\\nContent-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p>\\n\\n<p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is \"zoomed in\" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.

Unless they've been updated very recently, they don't separate the amount of time required to fetch JS over HTTP or load from cache versus the amount of time spent parsing the actual JS payload.</p>\\n\\n<p>Parse speed is slightly difficult to measure, but we've chased this metric a number of times on projects I've worked on and the impact on pageloads were significant even with ~500k of JS.  Obviously the older browsers suffer the most...hopefully Chrome, TraceMonkey and the like help resolve this situation.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Depending on the type of traffic you have at your site, it may be well worth your while to split up your JS payload so some large chunks of JS that will never be used on a the most popular pages are never sent down to the client.  Of course, this means that when a new client hits a page where this JS is needed, you'll have to send it over the wire.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, it may well be the case that, say, 50% of your JS is never needed by 80% of your users due to your traffic patterns.

You should see a listing including:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>java.lang.String cat(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);\\n  Code:\\n   0:   new     #2; //class java/lang/StringBuilder\\n   3:   dup\\n   4:   invokespecial   #3; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.\"&lt;init&gt;\":()V\\n   7:   aload_1\\n   8:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\\n   11:  aload_2\\n   12:  invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\\n   15:  invokevirtual   #5; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.toString:()Ljava/lang/    String;\\n   18:  astore_1\\n   19:  aload_1\\n   20:  areturn\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So, <code>a += b</code> is the equivalent of</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>a = new StringBuilder()\\n    .append(a)\\n    .append(b)\\n    .toString();\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The <code>concat</code> method should be faster. However, with more strings the <code>StringBuilder</code> method wins, at least in terms of performance.</p>\\n\\n<p>The source code of <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final <code>String</code>. In practice memory allocation is surprisingly fast.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> As Pawel Adamski notes, performance has changed in more recent HotSpot. <code>javac</code> still produces exactly the same code, but the bytecode compiler cheats. Simple testing entirely fails because the entire body of code is thrown away. Summing <code>System.identityHashCode</code> (not <code>String.hashCode</code>) shows the <code>StringBuffer</code> code has a slight advantage.

While some processors include the\\n  instructions for their predecessors,\\n  it\\'s generally true that a program\\n  that runs on one kind of computer\\n  won\\'t run on any other. Add in the\\n  services provided by the operating\\n  system, which each system describes in\\n  its own unique way, and you have a\\n  compatibility problem. In general, you\\n  can\\'t write and compile a program for\\n  one kind of system and run it on any\\n  other without a lot of work. Java gets\\n  around this limitation by inserting\\n  its virtual machine between the\\n  application and the real environment\\n  (computer + operating system). If an\\n  application is compiled to Java byte\\n  code and that byte code is interpreted\\n  the same way in every environment then\\n  you can write a single program which\\n  will work on all the different\\n  platforms where Java is supported.\\n  (That\\'s the theory, anyway. In\\n  practice there are always small\\n  incompatibilities lying in wait for\\n  the programmer.)</p></li>\\n  <li><p><strong>Security</strong>: One of Java\\'s virtues is its integration into the Web. Load\\n  a web page that uses Java into your\\n  browser and the Java code is\\n  automatically downloaded and executed.\\n  But what if the code destroys files,\\n  whether through malice or sloppiness\\n  on the programmer\\'s part? Java\\n  prevents downloaded applets from doing\\n  anything destructive by disallowing\\n  potentially dangerous operations.\\n  Before it allows the code to run it\\n  examines it for attempts to bypass\\n  security. It verifies that data is\\n  used consistently: code that\\n  manipulates a data item as an integer\\n  at one stage and then tries to use it\\n  as a pointer later will be caught and\\n  prevented from executing. (The Java\\n  language doesn\\'t allow pointer\\n  arithmetic, so you can\\'t write Java\\n  code to do what we just described.\\n  However, there is nothing to prevent\\n  someone from writing destructive byte\\n  code themselves using a hexadecimal\\n  editor or even building a Java byte\\n  code assembler.) It generally isn\\'t\\n  possible to analyze a program\\'s\\n  machine code before execution and\\n  determine whether it does anything\\n  bad. Tricks like writing\\n  self-modifying code mean that the evil\\n  operations may not even exist until\\n  later. But Java byte code was designed\\n  for this kind of validation: it\\n  doesn\\'t have the instructions a\\n  malicious programmer would use to hide\\n  their assault.</p></li>\\n  <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable\\n  over CISC. It\\'s better to have a small\\n  instruction set and use many fast\\n  instructions to do a job than to have\\n  many complex operations implemented as\\n  single instructions. RISC designs\\n  require fewer gates on the chip to\\n  implement their instructions, allowing\\n  for more room for pipelines and other\\n  techniques to make each instruction\\n  faster. In an interpreter, however,\\n  none of this matters. If you want to\\n  implement a single instruction for the\\n  switch statement with a variable\\n  length depending on the number of case\\n  clauses, there\\'s no reason not to do\\n  so. In fact, a complex instruction set\\n  is an advantage for a web-based\\n  language: it means that the same\\n  program will be smaller (fewer\\n  instructions of greater complexity),\\n  which means less time to transfer\\n  across our speed-limited network.</p></li>\\n  </ol>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'ll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It\\'s a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it \"just work.\"</p>\\n'},\n",

       "  'accepted_answer': '<p>A Hibernate session loads all data it reads from the DB into what they call the <i>first-level cache</i>. Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. </p>\\n\\n<p>From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.</p>\\n\\n<p>The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. </p>\\n\\n<p>The third option is to use a <i>second level cache</i> implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.</p>\\n'},\n",

They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.

Java has basic types which aren\\'t objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  <code>Array.sort</code> is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Properties.

This works, but still requires a lot of clicks. (I was able to use an invisible ActiveX control to detect things like File Size, which would be useful.)</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Flash Uploader</em>: I discovered a couple of Flash Upload controls that use a 1x1 flash file to act as the uploader, callable by javascript. (One such control is <a href=\"http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FancyUpload</a>, another is <a href=\"http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/09/02/the-dojo-toolkit-multi-file-uploader/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dojo\\'s Multiple File Uploader</a>, yet another is one by <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/FlashUpload.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">darick_c at CodeProject</a>.) These excited me, but I quickly ran into two issues:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Flash 10 will break the functionality that is used to call the multiple file upload dialogue box. The workaround is to use a transparent flash frame, or just use a flash button to call the dialogue box.

The workaround for this is to use cookieless sessions, which would be a nightmare for our project due to several other reasons.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p><em>Java Uploader</em>: I noticed several Java-based multiple-file uploaders, but most of the appear to cost money. If I found one that worked really well, I could arrange to purchase it. I\\'d just rather not. I also don\\'t like the look of most of them. I liked FancyUpload because it interacted with html/javascript so that I could easily style and manage it any way I want. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>ActiveX Uploader</em>: I found <a href=\"http://support.persits.com/xupload/demo1.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an ActiveX solution</a> as well.

The purpose of this application is to receive file uploads and save them to the proper place. Set this up as an anonymous access allowed.

Internet sites may be exposing themselves to security issues by doing this. Take extra precautions if that is the case.) The code behind for this page would look something like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>Dim uploads As HttpFileCollection = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files\\nIf uploads.Count &gt; 0 Then\\n    UploadFiles(uploads)\\nElse\\n    result = \"error\"\\n    err = \"File Not Uploaded\"\\nEnd If\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><strong>Application B</strong> is your primary site that will allow file uploads.

Then, place the <a href=\"http://digitarald.de/journal/54706744/fancyupload-for-flash-10/#comments\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FancyUpload</a> (or similar solution) on a page on this site.

The Java aspects of the code run the web UI and establish state on the devices that we're talking to, and the C++ code does the real-time crunching of data coming back from the devices. Shared memory is used to pass device state and context information from the Java code through to the C++ code. The Java code uses a PostgreSQL database to persist its state.</p>\\n\\n<p>We're running into some pretty severe performance bottlenecks, and right now the only way we can scale is to increase memory and CPU counts. We're stuck on the one physical box due to the shared memory design.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>The really big hit here is being taken by the C++ code. The web interface is fairly lightly used to configure the devices; where we're really struggling is to handle the data volumes that the devices deliver once configured.</p>\\n\\n<p>Every piece of data we get back from the device has an identifier in it which points back to the device context, and we need to look that up. Right now there's a series of shared memory objects that are maintained by the Java/UI code and referred to by the C++ code, and that's the bottleneck. Because of that architecture we cannot move the C++ data handling off to another machine. We need to be able to scale out so that various subsets of devices can be handled by different machines, but then we lose the ability to do that context lookup, and that's the problem I'm trying to resolve: how to offload the real-time data processing to other boxes while still being able to refer to the device context.</p>\\n\\n<p>I should note we have no control over the protocol used by the devices themselves, and there is no possible chance that situation will change.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>We know we need to move away from this to be able to scale out by adding more machines to the cluster, and I'm in the early stages of working out exactly how we'll do this.</p>\\n\\n<p>Right now I'm looking at Terracotta as a way of scaling out the Java code, but I haven't got as far as working out how to scale out the C++ to match.</p>\\n\\n<p>As well as scaling for performance we need to consider high availability as well.

       "  'context': '<p>While cross-site scripting is generally regarded as negative, I\\'ve run into several situations where it\\'s necessary.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was recently working within the confines of a very limiting content management system.  I needed to include database code within the page, but the hosting server didn\\'t have anything usable available.  I set up a couple bare-bones scripts on my own server, originally thinking that I could use AJAX to import the contents of my scripts directly into the template of the CMS (thus retaining dynamic images, menu items, CSS, etc.).  I was wrong.</p>\\n\\n<p>Due to the limitations of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> objects, it\\'s not possible to grab content from a different domain.  So I thought <em>iFrame</em> - even though I\\'m not a fan of frames, I thought that I could create a frame that matched the width and height of the content so that it would appear native.  Again, I was blocked by cross-site scripting \"protections.\"  While I could indeed load a remote file into the <em>iFrame</em>, I couldn\\'t execute JavaScript to modify its size on either the host page or inside the loaded page.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this particular scenario, I wasn\\'t able to point a subdomain to my server.  <strong>I also couldn\\'t create a script on the CMS server that could proxy content from my server, so my last thought was to use a remote JavaScript.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A remote JavaScript works.  It breaks when the user has JavaScript disabled, which is a downside; but it works.  The \"problem\" I was having with using a remote JavaScript was that I had to use the JS function <code>document.write()</code> to output any content.  Any output that isn\\'t JS causes script errors.  In addition to using <code>document.write()</code> for every line, you also have to ensure that the content is escaped - or else you end up with more script errors.</p>\\n\\n<p>My solution was as follows:</p>\\n\\n<p>My script received a GET parameter (\"page\") and then looked for the file (<code>{$page}.php</code>), and read the contents into a variable.  However, I had to use awkward buffering techniques in order to actually execute the included scripts (for things like database interaction) then strip the final content of all line break characters (<code>\\\\n</code>) followed by escaping all required characters.  The end result is that my original script (which outputs JavaScript) accesses seemingly \"standard\" scripts on my server and converts their standard output to JavaScript for displaying within the CMS template.</p>\\n\\n<p>While this solution works, it seems like there may be a better way to accomplish the same thing.  What is the best way to make cross-site scripting work specifically for the purpose of including content from a completely different domain?</p>\\n',\n",

So each time I closed all the connections App A would make a bunch of new connections as per it\\'s WEB.xml config file and run happily. App B would do the same. The problem is that they are <em>independent pools</em> which try to grab up to the server defined limit. It is a kind of race condition I guess. So when App A has finished with the connections it sits waiting to to use them again until the timeout has passed while App B who needs the connection now is denied the resources even though App A has finished with the and should be back in the pool. Once the timeout has passed, the connection is freed up and B (or C etc) can get at it again.</p>\\n\\n<p>e.g. if the limit is 10 (mySQL profile limit) and each app has been configured to use a max of 10 the there will be 20 attempts at connections.

In your case, this is good, because the <code>document.write</code> call would wipe out everything that\\'s already in the page. However, that leaves you without whatever HTML document.write was supposed to add.</p>\\n\\n<p>jQuery\\'s HTML manipulation methods will execute scripts in HTML for you, the trick is then capturing the calls to <code>document.write</code> and getting the HTML in the proper place.

Others are \"fixes\" that could not\\n  be implemented before for compatibility concerns, like the method\\n  resolution order in case of multiple inheritance.</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>Python 3 only has new-style classes</strong>. </p>\\n  \\n  <p>No matter if you subclass from <code>object</code> or not, classes are new-style\\n  in Python 3.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n'},\n",

Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>\\n\\n<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with <a href=\"https://jmockit.github.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JMockit</a> to not do anything. Let\\'s see this in example.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\\n  static {\\n    System.out.println(\"static initializer.\");\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Will be changed to</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\\n  static {\\n    staticInit();\\n  }\\n\\n  private static void staticInit() {\\n    System.out.println(\"static initialized.\");\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So that we can do the following in a <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JUnit</a>.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {\\n  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {\\n    public static void staticInit() {\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  @BeforeClass\\n  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {\\n    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can\\'t run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task?

AFAIK, there is still no support for WPF, WCF, WF, of WIF. Mono can run on iOS, but to my knowledge, the Java runtime still runs on far more platforms than Mono.  Also, Mono is starting to see some much improved tooling (Xamarin), and Microsoft seems to have a much more cross-platform kind of attitude and willingness to work with partners to make them complimentary, rather than competitive (for example, Mono will be a pretty important part of the upcoming OWIN/Helios ASP.NET landscape).

I think .NET, broadly, particularly with .NET Core, has started to achieve \"portability parity\" with Java.  There are efforts underway to bring WPF to .NET Core for some platforms, and .NET Core itself runs on a great many platforms now.  Mono (owned by Xamarin, which is now owned by Microsoft) is a more mature and polished product than ever, and writing applications that work on multiple platforms is no longer the domain of deep gnosis of .NET hackery, but is a relatively straightforward endeavor.  There are, of course, libraries and services and applications that are Windows-only or can only target specific platforms - but the same can be said of Java (broadly).  </p>\\n\\n<p>If I were in the OP\\'s shoes at this point, I can think of no reason inherent in the languages or tech stacks themselves that would prevent me from choosing .NET for any application going forward from this point.</p>\\n'},\n",

       "  'context': '<p>So I\\'ve done the trivial \"warmup\" apps with GAE.  Now I\\'d like to build something with a more complex directory structure.  Something along the lines of:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>siteroot/\\n    models/\\n    controllers/\\n        controller1/\\n        controller2/\\n        ...\\n    templates/\\n        template1/\\n        template2/\\n        ...\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>..etc.  The controllers will be Python modules handling requests.  They would then need to locate (Django-style) templates in associated folders.  Most of the demo apps I\\'ve seen resolve template paths like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \\'myPage.html\\')\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>...the __ file __ property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllers/controller1/, then the \\'myPage.html\\' would resolve to that same directory -- controllers/controller1/myPage.html -- and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.</p>\\n\\n<p>The solution I\\'ve hacked together feels... hacky:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>base_paths = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))\\ntemplate_dir = os.path.join(base_paths[0], \"templates\")\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So, I\\'m just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.  The other (non-GAE specific) solutions I\\'ve seen for resolving Python paths seem pretty heavyweight (such as splitting paths into lists and manipulating accordingly).  Django seems to have an answer for this, but I\\'d rather stick to the GAE API, vs. creating a full Django app and modifying it for GAE.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m assuming anything hard-coded would be non-starter, since the apps live on Google\\'s infinite server farm.

       "   'context': \"<p>I'm using pyOpenCL to do some complex calculations.\\nIt runs fine on CPU, but I get an error when trying to run it on an NVIDIA GeForce 9400M (256 MB).\\nI'm working on Mac OS X Lion (10.7.5)</p>\\n\\n<p>The strange thing is that this error does not always show up. It seems to occur when my calculations use larger numbers (resulting in larger iterations) but only when run on GPU.</p>\\n\\n<p>I'm not writing to memory locations I'm not supposed to write to. I ruled out possible problems with concurrent modification by running the code as a single work item.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>I simplified my OpenCL code as much as possible, and from what was left created some very simple code with extremely weird behavior that causes the <code>pyopencl.LogicError</code>. It consists of 2 nested loops in which a couple of assignments are made to the <code>result</code> array. This assignment need not even depend on the state of the loop.\\nThis is run on a single thread (or work item, <code>shape = (1,)</code>) on the GPU.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>__kernel void weirdError(__global unsigned int* result){\\n    unsigned int outer = (1&lt;&lt;30)-1;\\n    for(int i=20; i--; ){\\n        unsigned int inner = 0;\\n        while(inner != outer){\\n            result[0] = 1248;\\n            result[1] = 1337;\\n            inner++;\\n        }\\n        outer++;\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The strange part is that removing either one of the assignments to the result array removes the error. Also, decreasing the initial value for outer (down to <code>(1&lt;&lt;20)-1</code> for example) also removes the error. In these cases, the code returns normally, with the correct result available in the corresponding buffer.\\nOn CPU, it never raises an error.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>The OpenCL code is run from Python using PyOpenCL.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing fancy in the setup:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>platform = cl.get_platforms()[0]\\ndevice = platform.get_devices(cl.device_type.GPU)[0]\\ncontext = cl.Context([device])\\nprogram = cl.Program(context, getProgramCode()).build()\\nqueue = cl.CommandQueue(context)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In this Python code I set the <code>result_buf</code> to <code>0</code>, then I run the calculation in OpenCL that will set its values in a large iteration. Afterwards I try to collect this value from the device memory, but that's where it goes wrong:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>result = numpy.zeros(2, numpy.uint32)\\nresult_buf = cl.Buffer(context, mem_flags.READ_WRITE | mem_flags.COPY_HOST_PTR, hostbuf=result)\\n\\nshape = (1,)\\nprogram.weirdError(queue, shape, None, result_buf)\\n\\ncl.enqueue_copy(queue, result, result_buf)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The last line gives me:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>pyopencl.LogicError: clEnqueueReadBuffer failed: invalid command queue\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p><strong>How can this repeated assignment cause an error?</strong></p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>And more importantly: how can it be avoided?</strong></p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>I understand that this problem is probably platform dependent, and thus perhaps hard to reproduce. But this is the only machine I have access to, so the code should work on this machine.</p>\\n\\n<p>DISCLAIMER: I have never worked with OpenCL (or CUDA) before. I wrote the code on a machine where the GPU did not support OpenCL. I always tested it on CPU. Now that I switched to GPU, I find it frustrating that errors do not occur consistently and I have no idea why.</p>\\n\",\n",

The key is to add a class per code example you are using, here <code>.example-1</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>For some regex explanations, I refer you to <a href=\"https://regex101.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">regex101</a>. It\\'s a great tool with a very good explanation of all code in the right window. As you may know, you can use RegEx to match, but also to substitute. In the tool, at the bottom of the window, there\\'s \"Substitution\". Click on it, to open the window. The Regex at the top of the page will evaluate the \"Test string\", and substitute that string with your input in \"Substitution\". The result is in the bottom most field.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>CSS substitution</strong>:\\nFirst, let\\'s remove the CSS comment AND all spatial characters that might be in our way (removing means \"replace by an empty string\") - example: <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/cL0hL3/2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://regex101.com/r/cL0hL3/2</a></p>\\n\\n<p>The result will be something like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>div{\\nfont-size: 120%;\\n}\\ndiv span{\\nfont-size: 130%;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>But we want to make this style more specific. We want it to only apply to the div that\\'s inside <code>.lang-result</code> which, in turn, is part of the parent container <code>.example-1</code>. Therefore we need to add some things to the CSS. A useful thing to use is the dollar sign <code>$1</code> which in substitution will return the captured group (which in regex is in parentheses). <code>$1</code> returns the first captured group, <code>$2</code> the second one and so on. Here\\'s an example: <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/cL0hL3/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://regex101.com/r/cL0hL3/3</a>. The result will then look how we want:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>.parent-class .lang-result div{\\nfont-size: 120%;\\n}\\n.parent-class .lang-result div span{\\nfont-size: 130%;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><strong>JS substitution</strong>: the first part is identical to the CSS regex: remove the comment (doesn\\'t work with <code>//</code> comments only with <code>/*...*/</code>). That will lead to:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$(\"div\").hover(function(){\\n$(this).find(\"span\").css(\"fontSize\", \"140%\");\\n}, function(){\\n$(this).find(\"span\").css(\"fontSize\", \"130%\");\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Then we\\'ll have to change the base selector (the div) the only the div in our result (smilar to what we did in the case for CSS). This is a good time to show what capturing groups do (you can do this without using three groups, but it\\'s a good way to illustrate its possibilities:</p>\\n\\n<p>We replace this</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>(\\\\$\\\\(\")([^\"]+)(\"\\\\))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>with this</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$1.parent-class $2$3\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s crucial to see how <code>$1</code> is the first group <code>(\\\\$\\\\(\")</code> (literally <code>$(\"</code>, <code>$2</code> is whichever selector was already there, and <code>$3</code> is literally <code>\")</code>. Put that all together, and you have a new jQuery object.</p>\\n\\n<p>See it in action here. <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/cL0hL3/4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://regex101.com/r/cL0hL3/4</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Again there are many other ways to do that in regex, probably more efficient as well, but it\\'s a good showcase. I didn\\'t go into too much detail, but you can take the right window of the website as an explanation for what your regular expression does.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>If you want to apply this to multiple elements without manually added classes, you can do it like so: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/0c1np9uL/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jsfiddle.net/0c1np9uL/2/</a></p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$(\".code-box\").each(function () {\\n    var parent = $(this);\\n    parent.addClass(\"example-\" + parent.index());\\n\\n    var parentC = parent.attr(\"class\").match(/example-\\\\d+/),\\n        htmlSnip = parent.find(\".lang-html &gt; pre\").text().replace(\"&amp;lt;\", \"&lt;\").replace(\"&amp;gt;\", \"&gt;\"),\\n        cssSnip = parent.find(\".lang-css &gt; pre\").html().replace(/(\\\\/\\\\*.*\\\\*\\\\/\\\\n)|(^\\\\s*)/gm, \"\").replace(/^([^{\\\\n]+)(?={$)/gm, \".\" + parentC + \" .lang-result \" + \"$1\"),\\n        jsSnip = parent.find(\".lang-js &gt; pre\").html().replace(/(\\\\/\\\\*.*\\\\*\\\\/\\\\n)|(^\\\\s*)/gm, \"\").replace(/(\\\\$\\\\(\")([^\"]+)(\"\\\\))/gm, \"$1.\" + parentC + \" .lang-result \" + \"$2 $3\");\\n\\n    parent.find(\".lang-result\").html(htmlSnip).prepend(\"&lt;style&gt;\" + cssSnip + \"&lt;/style&gt;\" + \"&lt;script&gt;\" + jsSnip + \"&lt;\\\\/script&gt;\");\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n'}),\n",
